Abstract = {Barilla Center for Food and Nutrition decided to repropose an updated
   food pyramid, involving global warming and impacts of food on the
   environment. It has been made a reclassification of foods that together
   with their positive impacts on health also included their environmental
   impacts. These values were overlapped in descending order to obtain an
   upside-down pyramid that reproposes the same succession of foods. The
   new ``Double Pyramid{''} shows that foods with higher recommended
   consumption levels are also those with lower environmental impact, and
   foods with lower recommended consumption levels are those with higher
   environmental impact.
   Two daily menu were analysed: both balanced from a nutritional point of
   view, but in the first one the protein is of plant origin, while in the
   second one it is mainly of animal origin. Vegetarian menu has an
   environmental impact that is two and a half times lower than the animal
   protein-based one.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, there is a strong pressure to address the global warming
   problem at multiple levels. Wireless communication research is no
   exception: decreasing the carbon footprint of mass information
   communication technology (ICT) products and services is one of the major
   current research trends in telecommunication. Presently, 3\% {[}1] of
   the world-wide energy is consumed by ICT infrastructures, inducing about
   2\% {[}1] of the world-wide CO2 emissions. As conveyed data-volume
   increases very fast and wireless communications are increasingly used,
   network designs have pragmatically been refocused on energy-efficient
   designs able to limit CO2 emissions. This approach is currently
   addressed as ``Green Communications{''} in 4G networks. Significant
   energy savings in mobile networks can be expected by defining and
   standardizing energy-efficiency techniques, which include finding the
   trade-off between different engineering parameters such as
   spectral-efficiency (SE) and energy-efficiency (EE). This chapter
   discusses SE-EE trade-offs for OFDMA downlink systems in order to
   describe how combining adequate trade-offs allow us to make energy aware
   flexible radios and networks. Theoretical bounds for the single cell and
   multiple cell case are also presented. Finally, we analyzed the effect
   of circuit power on these trends.},

Abstract = {The project ``Developing a CCS communication framework for Japan{''}
   aims to test a prototype Knowledge Management System (KMS) on a pilot
   scale, with a view to more broadly utilizing the methodology in an
   international context. For this purpose, an on-line community was
   formed, involving CCS experts (10 to 15) from major Japanese CCS-related
   organizations. The Global (ITS Institute provided its digital platform
   to facilitate communication between members of the community.
   One of the toolkits, an ``argumentation model{''}, is developed to
   support structured and effective knowledge sharing. Arguments, evidence
   and criticisms that were identified through on-line discussion were
   structured in a hierarchy to form an argumentation model that overviews
   the justification for the claim that CCS is an effective measure to
   mitigate global warming in general and its effects on Japan in
   particular. The argumentation model provides a useful overview of
   arguments relating to CCS with explanation of background knowledge,
   supported by linked evidence and quantitative data.
   In addition, through the series of online discussions conducted during
   tins project, a number of lessons have been learned in terms of
   encouraging active participation of knowledge sharing network members.

Abstract = {This paper describes about the utilization of solar energy and the
   wireless transmission of the generated power. First the solar power is
   stored in a battery which is then transferred through wireless medium
   based on inductive coupling. There is a high thrust for renewable energy
   to mitigate the effect of global warming. The inductive power transfer
   has wide applications along with renewable energy. To demonstrate this
   solar based wireless power transfer system for home appliances has been
   developed. The advantage of this project is to increase the usage of
   renewable energy resources in order to reduce the CO emissions. And also
   the wireless power transfer system is a new way to transfer the power to
   the load rather than the conventional method of transferring power
   through livewires.},

Abstract = {With the threat of global warming nowadays in the 21st century, the
   European Union has set the standard ``Eco-Design Requirements for
   Energy-using Product(EuP){''} for controlling the development of
   consumptive electronic machinery and products. Therefore, the trend of
   green design sees the instruction of EuP as the main direction for
   energy-saving.
   Considering the factors, undergoing the comprehensive evaluation and
   development process, the industry needs to draw up the corresponding
   design strategy in response to the new situation. Therefore, to optimize
   the green design strategy, the designers can replace hardware with the
   intelligent system to develop more optimal energy-saving products.
   Following the ecological instructions of energy-saving of EuP as
   direction, this study combined the advantage of the intelligent system
   and green design in order to optimize strategy of green design on
   intelligent energy-saving product under eco-design requirements for
   energy-using product (EuP). The evaluation factors were included in the
   strategies of intelligent energy-saving product design by analyzing the
   product users' cognition, needs, habit and etc. Furthermore, through the
   Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FARE)), the priority and the important
   factors of green design were analyzed. By examining the green design
   strategy on energy-using product, industry needs to think the
   energy-saving conditions and the key factors on deciding process.
   Eventually, the efficiency of product design for environment can be
   fulfilled successfully.},

Pages = {3-20},
Abstract = {Individuals desire a coherent worldview that both maintains personal
   affective states and contains functional knowledge enabling the
   completion of quotidian tasks. To create such a worldview, individuals
   seek information from both large-scale and local reference groups. Thus,
   group membership serves an important epistemic function. In this
   article, the core properties of social knowledge formation are
   conceptualized as the ``epistemic calculus{''} of groups. Perceptions of
   low salience risks, such as global warming, are used to illustrate the
   social dimension of epistemic standards.},

Abstract = {A brief survey of issues prevalent in architectural debate reveals that
   computation and environment are two issues that have gained prominence
   over the past several decades, increasingly so since the beginning of
   the 21st century. Though both of importance, they are generally treated
   autonomously. On one hand, the environment is discussed in terms of
   global warming, the negative effects caused by the building industry and
   how to design in a way that will qualify a building for certification,
   such as; LEED, DGNB or Breeam. On the other hand, digital tools have
   stimulated a significant shift in the field of architecture. As digital
   tools have advanced from stages of `adoption' to `adaption', the
   interest has been augmented by a stance that aims to emphasize the use
   of generative tools that can facilitate an iterative approach to design.
   While various practitioners limit their position exclusively to `form',
   the authors argue that `function' should not be eschewed. The concept of
   function should be expanded to include environmental performance and
   should also play a pivotal role in the form finding process. In order to
   discuss this theme, the authors present several case studies of building
   envelopes. First, a case that considers environmental performance is
   contrasted with one that does not. Taking into consideration the paradox
   found, the authors use an academic project developed with parametric
   modeling, building information modeling (BIM) and architectural
   visualization software to show another process that looks beyond the
   surface and incorporates feedback from the physical and climatic context
   as parameters to consider as part of the design process.

Title = {Contrasting the Flow Patterns in the Equatorial Pacific Between Two
   Types of El Nino},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {51},
Number = {1},
Pages = {60-74},
Abstract = {Outputs based on the National Centers for Environmental Prediction
   (NCEP) Global Ocean Data Assimilation System (GODAS) are adopted to
   contrast the current variations in the equatorial Pacific between two
   types of El Nino. The model fully resolves the equatorial currents. We
   found that the central Pacific El Nino (CP-El Nino) corresponds well
   with previous El Nino studies in that both the eastward Equatorial
   Undercurrent (EUC) and westward South Equatorial Current (SEC) weaken.
   On the other hand, the eastern Pacific El Nino (EP-El Nino) displays a
   distinct circulation pattern. The North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC)
   strengthens in the developing phase and persists into the peak of the
   warm event, whereas the northern branch of the SEC (SECn) also
   intensifies during the mature phase and lasts for about six months. The
   South Equatorial Countercurrent (SECC) strengthens during the decaying
   phase of the EP-El Nino. The shifting of the wind stress curl associated
   with the thermocline variability is chiefly responsible for the unique
   current performance of the EP-El Nino. It is worth noting that the
   air-sea interaction plays an important role in the current variability
   not only during a CP-El Nino but also during an EP-El Nino.},

Abstract = {The high-tech industry, its associated Information and Communication
   Technologies (ICT), and subsequent e-business and Internet applications,
   have had profound effects on our economic lives, social development and
   environment. This revolutionary change is not only appreciated by
   computer gurus, but also by private and public organisations. This
   chapter attempts to focus on the relationship between the e-business/ICT
   and carbon emission-one of the causes of global warming. Aspects to be
   considered include energy consumption and CO2 emission associated with
   the Internet throughout its lifecycle-from manufacturing of Internet
   equipment/hardware to its usage and final disposal. On the other hand
   how Internet technology facilitates environment management and benefits
   industries via, for example Carbon Trading, will be discussed. The aim
   of this chapter is to provide a clarification and comprehensive picture
   of the carbon impact of ICT/e-business to private and public
   organisations as well as individuals, especially some
   ``behind-the-scene{''} type of facts. Therefore environmental factors
   can be taken into account for more informed decision-making during
   business conduction.},

Abstract = {One of the biggest issues ever since men realized that natural resources
   are going to be finished one day is to find a replacement, Apart from
   that fossil fuels is one of the key factors in global warming, pollution
   and greenhouse gas. In order to address such problems using renewable
   energies such as sunlight, wind, rain and so forth is essential in the
   current century which is named as green technology century as well. To
   do so The United Nations, governments, universities around the world,
   and environmental activists alongside with scientists who care about
   nature and future of the earth, have already started researches and
   investigations over possible ways to replace fossil fuels with a safer,
   cleaner and more economical source of energy. After years of researches
   and investigations, some of the new suggested energy sources are sun,
   wind, sea waves, rain, tides geothermal heat and some others. These new
   energy sources require devices and components to collect the energy and
   convert it to useable type of energy; therefore second phase is to
   design and build peripherals that can do the conversion. The famous
   results of this phase were solar panels and wind turbines which have
   been evolving during years. The idea proposed in this paper is about
   using wind turbines in highways in order to store, provide and
   distribute electricity for the highway and surrounding areas.},

Abstract = {Traditional wireless communication systems focus on Spectral Efficiency
   (SE) with excessive energy consumption. With widespread attention on
   global warming and excessive energy consumption, system designers began
   focusing on energy efficiency (EE) instead of the traditional spectral
   efficiency. A system that maximizes either spectral efficiency or energy
   efficiency without taking into account the variation of traffic load
   will lead to poor system performance in terms of outage probability,
   throughput and energy efficiency. To address this issue, in this paper
   we propose a Dynamic Traffic-aware Reconfiguration (DTR) scheme, aiming
   at maximizing the average system EE while guaranteeing the required
   system performance. This is fulfilled by reconfiguring the system to SE,
   EE or hybrid SE-EE system according to the traffic load. The key
   criterion for reconfiguring the system is the outage probability, which
   is estimated through using a queuing model. We implement DTR scheme in
   3GPP LTE system level simulator and conduct intensive simulation
   experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed DTR scheme.
   Numeric results show that DTR can maximize the average EE while
   guaranteeing the system performance compared to pure SE or EE system.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the argument patterns in Yahoo! Answers, a major
   question and answer (Q\&A) site. Mainly drawing on the ideas of Toulmin
   (), argument pattern is conceptualized as a set of 5 major elements:
   claim, counterclaim, rebuttal, support, and grounds. The combinations of
   these elements result in diverse argument patterns. Failed opening
   consists of an initial claim only, whereas nonoppositional argument
   pattern also includes indications of support. Oppositional argument
   pattern contains the elements of counterclaim and rebuttal. Mixed
   argument pattern entails all 5 elements. The empirical data were
   gathered by downloading from Yahoo! Answers 100 discussion threads
   discussing global warminga controversial topic providing a fertile
   ground for arguments for and against. Of the argument patterns, failed
   openings were most frequent, followed by oppositional, nonoppositional,
   and mixed patterns. In most cases, the participants grounded their
   arguments by drawing on personal beliefs and facts. The findings suggest
   that oppositional and mixed argument patterns provide more opportunities
   for the assessment of the quality and credibility of answers, as
   compared to failed openings and nonoppositional argument patterns.},

Abstract = {Environmental problems, such as pollution, become more serious year
   after year. One of the major causes is high fossil fuel consumption with
   CO2 emission. In 2009, 23 percent of CO2 emission globally came from
   land transportation systems, which is equal to 7000 million tons of CO2.
   This large amount of gas pollution should be reduced to slow down global
   environmental problems. Reduction of fuel consumption and CO2 emission
   in land transportation systems, which will have immediate positive
   economical and environmental impact, has become an important part of
   green technologies to alleviate global warming due to human activity.
   Intelligent transportation systems, which aim to use information and
   communication technology in the transportation systems, are considered
   to be a major enabler for the future green ITS. This article aims to
   provide a survey of the latest published applications based on vehicular
   communications as well as the envisaged technical challenges in this
   research area.},

Abstract = {Causality is the fabric of our dynamic world. We all make frequent
   attempts to reason causation relationships of everyday events (e. g.,
   what was the cause of my headache, or what has upset Alice?). We attempt
   to manage causality all the time through planning and scheduling. The
   greatest scientific discoveries are usually about causality (e. g.,
   Newton found the cause for an apple to fall, and Darwin discovered
   natural selection). Meanwhile, we continue to seek a comprehensive
   understanding about the causes of numerous complex phenomena, such as
   social divisions, economic crisis, global warming, home-grown terrorism,
   etc. Humans analyse and reason causality based on observation,
   experimentation and acquired a priori knowledge. Today's technologies
   enable us to make observations and carry out experiments in an
   unprecedented scale that has created data mountains everywhere. Whereas
   there are exciting opportunities to discover new causation
   relationships, there are also unparalleled challenges to benefit from
   such data mountains. In this article, we present a case for developing a
   new piece of ICT, called Causality Discovery Technology. We reason about
   the necessity, feasibility and potential impact of such a technology.},

Title = {Warming and nitrogen deposition lessen microbial residue contribution to
   soil carbon pool},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {3},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Microorganisms have a role as gatekeepers for terrestrial carbon fluxes,
   either causing its release to the atmosphere through their decomposition
   activities or preventing its release by stabilizing the carbon in a form
   that cannot be easily decomposed. Although research has focused on
   microbial sources of greenhouse gas production, somewhat limited
   attention has been paid to the microbial role in carbon sequestration.
   However, increasing numbers of reports indicate the importance of
   incorporating microbial-derived carbon into soil stable carbon pools.
   Here we investigate microbial residues in a California annual grassland
   after a continuous 9-year manipulation of three environmental factors
   (elevated CO2, warming and nitrogen deposition), singly and in
   combination. Our results indicate that warming and nitrogen deposition
   can both alter the fraction of carbon derived from microbes in soils,
   though for two very different reasons. A reduction in microbial carbon
   contribution to stable carbon pools may have implications for our
   predictions of global change impacts on soil stored carbon.},

Abstract = {Cars with petrol driven internal combustion engines are constant sources
   for air pollution. As alternative car engines have not yet replaced the
   petrol-driven engines, road transportation is today still responsible
   for large emissions of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons,
   and many other organic compounds into the environment. These chemicals
   produce great damage to our health (e.g., respiratory diseases,
   irritation to the eyes), and to the environment (e.g., global warming,
   acid rains). There is a direct relation between the car's emissions and
   its acceleration: an accelerating car will pollute more than a
   non-speeding car. Imagine a car approaching an intersection with the
   traffic lights showing green color. The driver can accelerate (hoping
   that she/he will be able to pass) or not (bring the car to a safe speed,
   but risking missing the green). In this paper we present an ITS-based
   system capable of guiding the driver's decisions with the goal of
   reducing vehicle emissions. The system considers parameters ranging from
   the car's characteristics to human reactions. In this we present results
   demonstrating the capability of the system to produce decisions that
   reduce pollution in urban traffic environments.},

Abstract = {As sessile, plants are continuously exposed to potential dangers
   including various abiotic stresses and pathogen attack. Although most
   studies focus on plant responses under an ideal condition to a specific
   stimulus, plants in nature must cope with a variety of stimuli at the
   same time. This indicates that it is critical for plants to fine-control
   distinct signaling pathways temporally and spatially for simultaneous
   and effective responses to various stresses. Global warming is currently
   a big issue threatening the future of humans. Reponses to high
   temperature affect many physiological processes in plants including
   growth and disease resistance, resulting in decrease of crop yield.
   Although plant heat stress and defense responses share important
   mediators such as calcium ions and heat shock proteins, it is thought
   that high temperature generally suppresses plant immunity. We therefore
   specifically discuss on interactions between plant heat and defense
   responses in this review hopefully for an integrated understanding of
   these responses in plants.},

Abstract = {CO2 emission from fossil fuel combustion is a major anthiopogenic factor
   for global warming. Solid amine sorbents may be used to remove CO2 from
   waste flue gases before their emission into the atmosphere These
   particles are currently obtained by loading amine containing compounds
   or polymers onto premade or commercially available porous supports.
   These supports play no active role in CO2 uptake and increase the amount
   Of heat or cost required to regenerate CO2. sorbed particles by heating.
   Reported in this communication are the preparation, by precipitation

Abstract = {Cloud computing services have recently become a ubiquitous service
   delivery model, covering a wide range of applications from personal file
   sharing to being an enterprise data warehouse. Building green data
   center networks providing cloud computing services is an emerging trend
   in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry, because
   of Global Warming and the potential GHG emissions resulting from cloud
   services. As one of the first worldwide initiatives provisioning ICT
   services entirely based on renewable energy such as solar, wind and
   hydroelectricity across Canada and around the world, the GreenStar
   Network (GSN) was developed to dynamically transport user services to be
   processed in data centers built in proximity to green energy sources,
   reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions of ICT equipments. Regarding the
   current approach, which focuses mainly in reducing energy consumption at
   the micro-level through energy efficiency improvements, the overall
   energy consumption will eventually increase due to the growing demand
   from new services and users, resulting in an increase in GHG emissions.
   Based on the cooperation between Mantychore FP7 and the GSN, our
   approach is, therefore, much broader and more appropriate because it
   focuses on GHG emission reductions at the macro-level. This article
   presents some outcomes of our implementation of such a network model,
   which spans multiple green nodes in Canada, Europe and the USA. The
   network provides cloud computing services based on dynamic provision of
   network slices through relocation of virtual data centers. (C) 2012

Abstract = {Wind turbine use is expanding throughout the world as a means to provide
   electricity without contributing to the increase in global-warming
   gases. Most commonly, very large, horizontal-axis turbines are
   constructed in fleets that are connected to national-level electrical
   grid systems. More recently, there has been a desire for more local,
   small-scale power production that can be used to power very specific
   pieces of equipment or buildings. Some of the small-scale turbines are
   designed differently from their larger counterparts-they are driven by
   drag forces rather than by lift. Drag-driven turbines are typically
   called Savonius turbines. This paper, which presents a historical
   perspective on Savonius turbines, will illustrate their potential for
   providing local power. Finally, we will discuss recent developments in
   analysis methods which intend to optimize Savonius turbines for powering
   cellular communication towers in developing parts of the world. (C) 2012

Abstract = {In recent years a growing concern for global warming and environmental
   issues has become apparent. Turkey as a rapidly developing country has
   several environmental problems. In that situation, the attitudes towards
   to environment and the consciousness level of the Turkish consumers have
   gained much more importance. For the purpose of increasing the level of
   consciousness about environmental issues, communication professionals
   have to establish a relationship between a positive environmental
   attitudes and environmentally responsible behaviors through the means of
   communication. Before designing and implementing any kind of
   communication process, the characteristics and current consciousness
   level of target group has to be clearly identified. Therefore, the aim
   of this study is to explore the attitudes of the Turkish consumers
   regarding to their current environmental consciousness and their
   willingness to adopt environmentally friendly consumption behavior. The
   environmental consciousness survey used in this study was delivered to
   the 186 students of 298 attending the first year obligatory courses in
   Communication Sciences Faculty. In this study, the environmental
   consciousness was formed by the factors related to awareness and act,
   concern about environment and willingness, were statistically were
   analyzed in terms of the opinions of the respondents concerning the
   environmental consciousness in terms of gender, the region that they
   came from, their department in the faculty of communication sciences,
   education level of parents, any kind of training concerning the
   environmental issues or any environmental associations or social clubs
   memberships.},

Abstract = {Pulp and paper manufacturing constitutes one of the largest industry
   segments in term of water and energy usage and total discharges to the
   environment. More than many other industries, however, this industry
   plays a key role in sustainable development because its most important
   raw material, wood fiber, is renewable Dias and Houtman (Environ Prog
   23(4):347-357, 2004). Actually, even if the communication is dominated
   by electronic media, paper-based communication has a role to play due to
   its unique practical and aesthetic qualities. This research aims to
   assess the environmental impact of advertising folders produced with
   different papers and distributed by a system of Italian consumers'
   cooperatives in order to indicate the possible options of improvement
   and to assess the CO2 (eq) emitted during the entire life cycle.
   Life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed from cradle-to-grave
   considering paper production, transport from paper mill to printing
   site, printing, distribution, and disposal. Data for the study were
   directly collected from specific companies and completed on the basis of
   literature information. The analysis was conducted using the SimaPro
   7.1.5 software and IMPACT 2002+ method to assess all its environmental
   impact and damage categories.
   LCA analysis indicates that the higher environmental impact is mainly
   due to paper production and printing processes. The main operations
   which generate the major impact in the paper production stage are
   related to the direct or indirect fossil energy use, the production of
   additives for bleaching operations, and the collection and selection of
   waste paper. Printing causes relevant impacts for the electricity and
   ink production and for the aluminum plates used in the offset printing.
   Moreover, the use of paper with low quantity of additives and small
   amount of primary fibers causes a reduction of the environmental load of
   13.94 \%. The major global warming potential value was found for
   advertising folders made with little amount of mechanical pulp which
   slightly contributes to the absorption of CO2.
   The analysis pointed out the relevance of the paper production phase and
   of the printing step within the advertising folders life cycle and
   allowed to detect the other critical stages of the life cycle. Paper
   composition greatly affects the environmental impact of the advertising
   folders' life cycle.},

Abstract = {The environmental profile of a set of wood furniture was carried out to
   define the best design criteria for its eco-design. A baby cot
   convertible into a bed, a study desk and a bedside table were the
   objects of study. Two quantitative and qualitative environmental
   approaches were combined in order to propose improvement alternatives:
   Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Design for Environment (DfE). In the
   first case Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was applied to identify the hot
   spots in the product system. As a next step, LCA information was used in
   eco-briefing to determine several improvement alternatives. A wood
   products company located in Catalonia (NE Spain) was assessed in detail,
   dividing the process into three stages: assembly, finishing and
   packaging. Ten impact categories were considered in the LCA study:
   abiotic depletion, acidification, eutrophication, global warming, ozone
   layer depletion, human toxicity, fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity, marine
   aquatic ecotoxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity and photochemical oxidant
   formation. Two processes can be considered the key environmental
   factors: the production of the wooden boards and electricity, with
   contributions of 45-68\% and 14-33\% respectively depending on the
   impact categories. Subsequently, several improvement alternatives were
   proposed in the eco-design process (DfE) to achieve reductions in a
   short-medium period of time in the environmental impact. These
   eco-design strategies could reduce the environmental profile of the
   setup by 14\%. The correct methodological adaptation of the concept of
   eco-briefing, as a tool for communication among environmental
   technicians and designers, the simplification of the analytical tool
   used and the LCA, could facilitate the environmental analysis of a
   product. The results obtained provide information that can help the
   furniture sector to improve their environmental performance. (C) 2012

Abstract = {Terminal heat, which is referred as increase in temperature during grain
   filling, is one of the important stress factors for wheat production.
   Current estimates indicate that wheat crop grown on around 13.5 m ha in
   India is affected by heat stress. In order to meet the challenges of
   high temperature ahead of global warming, concerted efforts are needed
   to evaluate germplasm for heat tolerance and identify and develop
   genotypes suitable for such stressed environments. The advanced wheat
   genotypes developed for stress and normal environments by different
   research centers were evaluated across 7 locations representing varied
   agroclimatic zones during 2007-08 and 2008-09 to study their
   adaptability for heat stress and non-stress environments. The additive
   main effects and multiplicative interaction analysis for G x E
   interactions revealed differences amongst locations to phenology and
   grain yield. Genotype RAJ 4083 developed for cultivation under late sown
   conditions in peninsular zone was also found adaptable to timely sown
   conditions. Similarly, HD 2733 a cultivar of NEPZ timely sown conditions
   and PBW 574 an advanced breeding line of NWPZ late sown conditions was
   found adapted to Peninsular zone. The cultivar RAJ 3765 showed specific
   adaptability to Pantnagar in NWPZ. Genotype NW 3069 developed for NEPZ
   timely sown conditions have shown adaptability to number of locations;
   timely sown conditions at Karnal and Hisar in NWPZ and Niphad in PZ.
   Likewise, WH 1022 developed for NEPZ late sown conditions exhibited
   specific adaptability to all timely sown locations in NWPZ.},

   Networks: A Consideration of an ADC Device},

Abstract = {Cognitive networks (CNs) are capable of enabling dynamic spectrum
   allocation, and thus constitute a promising technology for future
   wireless communication. Whereas, the implementation of CN will lead to
   the requirement of an increased energy-arrival rate, which is a
   significant parameter in energy harvesting design of a cognitive user
   (CU) device. A well-designed spectrum-sensing scheme will lower the
   energy-arrival rate that is required and enable CNs to self-sustain,
   which will also help alleviate global warming. In this paper, spectrum
   sensing in a multi-user cognitive ad hoc network with a wide-band
   spectrum is considered. Based on the prospective spectrum sensing, we
   classify CN operation into two modes: Distributed and centralized. In a
   distributed network, each CU conducts spectrum sensing for its own data
   transmission, while in a centralized network, there is only one
   cognitive cluster header which performs spectrum sensing and broadcasts
   its sensing results to other CUs. Thus, a wide-band spectrum that is
   divided into multiple sub-channels can be sensed simultaneously in a
   distributed manner or sequentially in a centralized manner. We consider
   the energy consumption for spectrum sensing only of an analog-to-digital
   convertor (ADC). By formulating energy consumption for spectrum sensing
   in terms of the sub-channel sampling rate and whole-band sensing time,
   the sampling rate and whole-band sensing time that are optimal for
   minimizing the total energy consumption within sensing reliability
   constraints are obtained. A power dissipation model of an ADC, which
   plays an important role in formulating the energy efficiency problem, is
   presented. Using AD9051 as an ADC example, our numerical results show
   that the optimal sensing parameters will achieve a reduction in the
   energy-arrival rate of up to 97.7\% and 50\% in a distributed and a
   centralized network, respectively, when comparing the optimal and
   worst-case energy consumption for given system settings.},

Abstract = {Chlorine refrigerants are considered global warming materials.
   Chlorinated refrigerants are being replaced with low chlorine content
   refrigerants, such as HFCs (CH3CF3, CH3CHF2, CH2FCF3, CHF2CF3, CH2F2).
   Predicting the cooling domain in the operating temperature-pressure
   range of refrigerants is very important. In this study, the cooling
   domain for the nonchlorine refrigerants was predicted and compared with
   the value for chlorine refrigerants, HCFCs (CH3CClF2, CH3CCl2F,
   CHClFCF3, CHCl2CF3, CHClF2). The cooling domain was depicted with
   Joule-Thomson coefficient (mu(integral r)). The mathematical algorithm
   of the Joule-Thomson coefficient was derived from the cubic type
   equation of states, van der Waals (vdW), Redlich-Kwong (RK),
   Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK), Peng-Robinson (PR). Joule-Thomson
   coefficients had different types with the equation of state. The maximum
   inversion pressure and corresponding temperature were proposed from each
   inversion curve. From these results, the refrigeration working domains
   of the green refrigerants were predicted. (C) 2011 The Korean Society of

Abstract = {Fiber-Wireless (FiWi) broadband access network is a promising ``last
   mile{''} access technology, because it integrates wireless and optical
   access technologies in terms of their respective merits, such as high
   capacity and stable transmission from optical access technology, and
   easy deployment and flexibility from wireless access technology. Since
   FiWi is expected to carry a large amount of traffic, numerous traffic
   flows may be interrupted by the failure of network components. Thus,
   survivability in FiWi is a key issue aiming at reliable and robust
   service. However, the redundant deployment of backup resource required
   for survivability usually causes huge energy consumption, which
   aggravates the global warming and accelerates the incoming of energy
   crisis. Thus, the energy-saving issue should be considered when it comes
   to survivability design. In this paper, we focus on the green
   survivability in FiWi, which is an innovative concept and remains
   untouched in the previous works to our best knowledge. We first review
   and discuss some challenging issues about survivability and
   energy-saving in FiWi, and then we propose some instructive solutions
   for its green survivability design. Therefore, our work in this paper
   will provide the technical references and research motivations for the
   energy-efficient and survivable FiWi development in the future. (C) 2011

Title = {Three decades of high-resolution coastal sea surface temperatures reveal
   more than warming},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Understanding and forecasting current and future consequences of coastal
   warming require a fine-scale assessment of the near-shore temperature
   changes. Here we show that despite the fact that 71\% of the world's
   coastlines are significantly warming, rates of change have been highly
   heterogeneous both spatially and seasonally. We demonstrate that 46\% of
   the coastlines have experienced a significant decrease in the frequency
   of extremely cold events, while extremely hot days are becoming more
   common in 38\% of the area. Also, we show that the onset of the warm
   season is significantly advancing earlier in the year in 36\% of the
   temperate coastal regions. More importantly, it is now possible to
   analyse local patterns within the global context, which is useful for a
   broad array of scientific fields, policy makers and general public.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, with the development of industrialization and urbanization,
   air pollution has been a serious problem all of the word. Air pollutant
   is harmful to human and ecological environment, for example, SO2 and NO2
   produced by industry are vital to living organisms, greenhouse air such
   as CO2 causes global warming. As a result, environmental monitoring is
   of great importance for human beings.
   This paper proposes a scheme to implement environmental monitoring. In
   particular, wireless sensor network collect data from surrounding
   environment and mobile communication system receive and process these
   data. To avoid network congestion, a cognitive protocol is proposed for
   wireless sensors accessing to mobile network. Besides that, a dynamic
   working scheme is also proposed for sensors so that data collection rate
   can be adapted to the situation of network. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The explosive development of Information and Communication Technology
   (ICT) has significantly enlarged both the energy demands and the CO2
   emissions, and consequently contributes to make the energy crisis and
   global warming problems worse. However, as the main force of the ICT
   field, the mobile networks, are currently focusing on the capacity,
   variety and stability of the communication services, without paying too
   much severe concerns on the energy efficiency. The escalating energy
   costs and environmental concerns have already created an urgent need for
   more energy-efficient ``green{''} wireless communications. In this
   paper, we survey and discuss various remarkable techniques toward green
   mobile networks, to mainly targeting mobile cellular networks. We also
   summarize the current research projects related to green mobile
   networks, along with the taxonomy of energy-efficiency metrics. We
   finally discuss and elaborate future research opportunities and design
   challenges for green mobile networks.},

Abstract = {Previous efforts on modeling of energy and environment are critically
   examined and the structure of energy and environment system model is
   described. The modeling of energy and environment for sustainable
   development using Bangladesh as a case of illustrative example is
   presented. The computer model essentially consists of a system dynamics
   model in combination with Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning
   (LEAP). The output of the system dynamics model is fed into the LEAP
   model. The model projects energy supply and demand and its contribution
   to global warming. Simulated results show that the energy demands in all
   sectors of the economy are increasing with time. The demand for
   electrical energy is also increasing and there is shortage of electric
   power. The performance of the electric power generation and utilization
   can be improved through reduction of system loss and introduction of
   end-use efficiency improvement devices. However, generation capacity
   needs to be increased for sustainable development with gradual
   transition to renewable energy resources. Power cannot reach everywhere
   and mini-grids for supply of energy, information, and communication for
   rural development and economic growth for isolated areas such as islands
   are advocated. Bangladesh is responsible for a small fraction of the
   total anthropogenic contribution of CO2 but could be seriously affected
   by climatic change. LEAP in combination with a system dynamics model is
   more effective than LEAP alone for energy and environmental planning for
   sustainable development.},

Title = {Role of Soil Organic Matter in Maintaining Sustainability of Cropping
   Systems},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {43},
Number = {16},
Pages = {2063-2113},
Abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) has long been recognized as an important
   indicator of soil productivity. The SOM refers to the organic fraction
   of the soil exclusive of undecayed plant and animal residues. It plays a
   crucial role in maintaining sustainability of cropping systems by
   improving soil physical (texture, structure, bulk density, and
   water-holding capacity), chemical (nutrient availability, cation
   exchange capacity, reduced aluminum toxicity, and allelopathy), and
   biological (nitrogen mineralization bacteria, dinitrogen fixation,
   mycorrhizae fungi, and microbial biomass) properties. The preservation
   of SOM is crucial to ensure long-term sustainability of agricultural
   ecosystems. Improvement/preservation of soil organic matter can be
   achieved by adopting appropriate soil and crop management practices.
   These practices include conservation tillage, crop rotation, use of
   organic manures, increasing cropping intensity, use of adequate rate of
   chemical fertilizers, incorporation of crop residues, liming acidic
   soils, and keeping land under pasture. Organic matter can adsorb heavy
   metals in the soils, which reduce toxicity of these metals to plants and
   reduce their escape to ground water. Similarly, SOM also adsorbs
   herbicides, which may inhibit contamination of surface and ground water.
   Furthermore, SOM also functions as a sink to organic carbon and
   mitigates carbon dioxide (CO2) gas escape to the environment. Globally,
   soil organic matter contains about three times as much carbon as found
   in the world's vegetation. Hence, organic matter plays a critical role
   in the global carbon balance that is thought to be the major factor
   affecting global warming. Overall, adequate amounts of soil organic
   matter maintain soil quality, preserve sustainability of cropping
   systems, and reduce environmental pollution.},

Abstract = {Energy consumption in telecommunication networks keeps growing rapidly,
   mainly due to emergence of new Cloud Computing (CC) services that need
   to be supported by large data centers that consume a huge amount of
   energy and, in turn, cause the emission of enormous quantity of CO2.
   Given the decreasing availability of fossil fuels and the raising
   concern about global warming, research is now focusing on novel
   ``low-carbon{''} telecom solutions. E.g., based on today telecom
   technologies, data centers can be located near renewable energy plants
   and data can then be effectively transferred to these locations via
   reconfigurable optical networks, based on the principle that data can be
   moved more efficiently than electricity. This paper focuses on how to
   dynamically route on-demand optical circuits that are established to
   transfer energy-intensive data processing towards data centers powered
   with renewable energy. Our main contribution consists in devising two
   routing algorithms for connections supporting CC services, aimed at
   minimizing the CO2 emissions of data centers by following the current
   availability of renewable energy (Sun and Wind). The trade-off with
   energy consumption for the transport equipments is also considered. The
   results show that relevant reductions, up to about 30\% in CO2 emissions
   can be achieved using our approaches compared to baseline
   shortest-path-based routing strategies, paying off only a marginal
   increase in terms of network blocking probability.},

Abstract = {Being information and science literate are crucial in an age when
   scientific developments influence the political arena and vice versa. In
   order to become active and responsible citizens, students must
   understand such issues as global warming and stem cell research.
   Furthermore, they must be lifelong learners, capable of researching and
   educating themselves about new scientific developments. These are some
   of the complex issues that information literacy educators must address.
   This article reports on the results of a survey of student's attitudes
   towards science literacy and lifelong learning, their assessment of
   their own levels of science literacy, and on variables associated with
   their attitudes. Most of the students' attitudes and self-ratings were
   positive, especially those who majored in one of the science
   disciplines.},

Abstract = {Recently, many studies dealing with energy saving have been conducted
   from the viewpoint of mitigating global warming. However, most of them
   only consider energy saving and ignore the total environmental impact.
   It is necessary to provide a comfortable work space using efficient and
   optimized energy control, because excessive demand control can have a
   negative impact on the environment. It can also have a negative impact
   on working or learning efficiency. To provide a comfortable indoor
   environment, it is important to measure environmental indexes, including
   not only temperature, humidity, illuminance, and wind speed, but also
   CO2 concentration. Moreover, to forecast air conditioner demand, it is
   important to know the number of people in the controlled space. In this
   paper, we propose a new method to estimate the number of people in a
   ventilation-controlled environment by using a CO2 sensor. The proposed
   method will provide a demand control system that achieves more
   intelligent and accurate control of ventilation fans.},

   systems based on the regional experiment. Through these technologies, we
   will investigate the world's first ``Green-oriented Network Management

Abstract = {Given the growing concern over energy consumption and associated global
   warming, green communication is becoming more and more important. Lots
   of efforts have been put into investigating energy efficiency based
   design in wireless systems. Unfortunately, the maximum energy efficiency
   of a point-to-point link is normally achieved when the transmit power
   approaches zero, which, however, is not desirable in practical systems
   due to the low achievable data rate. In this paper, we consider the
   energy efficiency optimization with a practical power consumption model,
   where, besides a maximum transmit power constraint, we set a rate
   constraint (r(0)) to guarantee an average throughput requirement (R-th).
   Due to the possible outage in transmission, r(0) is in general different
   from R-th, and determining r(0) for a given R-th is not trivial. We
   shall derive a closed-form solution for the optimal transmit power that
   maximizes energy efficiency. We will also demonstrate that a carefully
   selected rate constraint r(0) can guarantee the required average
   throughput R-th and provide the freedom to achieve different tradeoffs
   between energy efficiency and average throughput.},

Abstract = {Centuries ago, the major function of residential buildings was to
   provide a shelter to humans, protecting from wind, rain and dust. Later
   on, economic development in our society leads us to an increase in
   requirement on dwellings' quality. Comfortable indoor environment
   becomes a must in home selection criteria. Nowadays, residential units
   continue to serve the abovementioned functions. Nevertheless, people has
   a higher demand. The global warming drives us to looks for ways to
   minimize the negative environmental impact. With the help of content
   analysis, this paper studies the Hong Kong sustainable smart home

Abstract = {The present electric power system structure has lasted for decades; it
   is still partially proprietary, energy-inefficient, physically and
   virtually (or cyber) insecure, as well as prone to power transmission
   congestion and consequent failures. Recent efforts in building a smart
   grid system have focused on addressing the problems of global warming
   effects, rising energy-hungry demands, and risks of peak loads. One of
   the major goals of the new system is to effectively regulate energy
   usage by utilizing the backbone of the prospectively deployed Automatic
   Meter Reading (AMR), Advanced Meter Infrastructure (AMI), and Demand
   Response (DR) programs via the advanced distribution automation and
   dynamic pricing models. The function of the power grid is no longer a
   system that only supplies energy to end users, but also allows consumers
   to contribute their clean energy back to the grid in the future.
   In the meantime, communications networks in the electric power
   infrastructure enact critical roles. Intelligent automation proposed in
   smart grid projects include the Supervisory Control And Data
   Acquisition/Energy Management Systems (SCADA/EMS) and Phasor Management
   Units (PMU) in transmission networks, as well as the AMR/AMI associated
   with field/neighborhood area networks (FAN/NAN) and home area networks
   (HAN) at the distribution and end-use levels. This article provides an
   overview of the essentials of the progressive smart grid paradigm and
   integration of different communications technologies for the legacy
   power system. Additionally, foreseeable issues and challenges in
   designing communications networks for the smart grid system are also
   rigorously deliberated in this paper.},

Abstract = {Reducing power consumption in access networks has become an increasingly
   important design goal due to increased concerns for both global warming
   and network operation costs. Although passive optical networks (PONs)
   consume the least power among all access network technologies, it is
   desirable to further reduce PON's power consumption, especially when the
   line rate is being increased to 10Gbps (10G) and wider deployment is
   underway. Generally, an effective approach to reduce power consumption
   is to use sleep-mode operation where functionality is powered off during
   periods of idleness. This paper therefore proposes a sleep-mode based
   power saving protocol applied to an optical line terminal (OLT) and
   optical network units (ONUs) to implement ONU power saving in
   10G-Ethernet- PON (10G-EPON) systems. The proposed protocol explicitly
   distinguishes sleep-, listen-, and awake-states with different power
   consumption levels. In addition, the paper proposes analytical models
   for ONU power consumption and response delay to evaluate performance of
   the proposed power saving protocol. The simulations show that the
   proposed protocol can significantly improve ONU power saving. The
   validity of the numerical models is also confirmed by extensive
   simulations.},

Abstract = {The greenhouse effect and the global warming are of a great importance
   and live questions concerning the life on Earth. A model of a flat
   greenhouse made of adequate light plastic material, which is thermally
   insulated and tanned inside, is prepared. The beams of the light
   stimulator hit perpendicularly a transparent covering (made of glass and
   plastic folio). The temperature inside the greenhouse is measured with a
   preliminary calibrated differential thermal coupling of chromel-copel
   with a precision of 0.1 degrees C.
   During the process of investigation theoretically a formula for the
   temperature fluctuations inside the greenhouse as a function of time is
   worked out. It is suggested that the input energy (from Sun light or
   light source and environment) is constant.
   The proposed calculation method allows the temperature value calculation
   inside the greenhouse in the course of time. The graphically measured
   during the experiment temperatures (T-exp) and the theoretically
   calculated temperatures (T-calc) are compared. Good concurrence of the
   experiment and theoretical data is observed.},

Abstract = {A life cycle simulation tool has been developed to model urban
   settlements including various buildings, streets, green and other public
   spaces, and networks (drinking water, waste water, district heating...).
   This tool, developed in an object oriented approach, associates dynamic
   thermal simulation and building LCA, complemented with modules for open
   spaces and networks. A set of environmental indicators is evaluated,
   e.g. resource depletion, energy and water consumption, global warming,
   waste generation, toxicity. Several alternatives can be compared using
   graphs, constituting an urban design aid.
   This communication presents a case study in order to illustrate a
   possible application of this tool. Several urban morphologies are
   compared: apartment buildings, single family houses, and Plus energy
   houses similar to the ``solar city{''} in Freiburg. Each alternative is
   defined according to the same functional unit: providing dwelling for
   one inhabitant during 80 years, in the Greater Paris Area context and
   climatic conditions. The results are presented and perspectives are
   proposed to refine the model and complement it.},

Abstract = {Global warming and carbon emissions have gained international attention.
   However, it would appear that consumers are still unclear about what it
   encompasses and how it relates to their individual behaviour. Using the
   Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) as a guiding framework, this study
   presents a structural equation model that tests the relationships
   between carbon and environmental knowledge, environmental attitude and
   behaviour using a sample of US consumers. The findings of the research
   suggest that a positive relationship was found between general and
   carbon-specific knowledge, attitude towards the environment, and general
   and carbon-specific behaviours. Therefore, general and carbon-specific
   environmental behaviours are related and may be driven by general
   attitudes and knowledge (i.e. both carbon-specific and general
   environmental knowledge). The implications of the study would suggest
   that marketers, working in tandem with government policymakers, need to
   focus efforts on developing consumers' knowledge about specific
   sub-issues, such as global warming. However, additional research needs
   to be undertaken to develop marketing communication that accurately
   reflects the environmental impact of consumption behaviour, thereby
   allowing for considered consumption.},

Abstract = {This article examines Rachel Carson's assimilation and revision of
   scientific uncertainty in her sources, annotations, and drafts for
   Silent Spring. It argues that Carson's emphasis on the special topos of
   uncertainty was not an original invention but instead was Carson's
   contribution to an ongoing scientific and political conversation about
   uncertainty in 1962. Carson transformed this topos into a bridge across
   the is-ought divide in science-related policy making, using the
   uncertainty topos to invite the public to participate by supplying fears
   and values that would warrant proposals for limiting pesticide use.
   Carson's adaptation of scientific uncertainty to environmental policy
   making provides a historical precedent for contemporary invocations of
   scientific uncertainty in debates surrounding global warming, nuclear
   power, cancer studies, and Gulf oil drilling. The methods that the
   authors use to trace the development of this special topos can also
   serve as a pattern for excavating the histories of other pivotal topoi
   in the rhetoric of American science and environmental policy.},

Abstract = {With the growing awareness of dual threats of global warming and ozone
   depletion, environmentally benign natural refrigerants have attracted
   considerable attention. As a natural refrigerant, CO2 is a potential
   substitute for synthesized refrigerants with favorable environmental
   properties. In order to improve the performance of the transcritical CO2
   compression cycle, the mathematical models of three kinds single stage
   cycle and three kinds two stage cycle were developed and the
   performances were analyzed. The results showed that the optimum
   intermediate pressure affects the performance of transcritical CO2 two
   stage compression cycle. The system COP increases with the evaporating
   temperature rises. Oppositely, the COP decreases with the cooled
   temperature rises. Some fundamental data were obtained for improving
   cycle performance and developing the products of CO2 refrigeration air
   condition and heat pumps.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this quantitative study is to understand the attitudes of
   Taiwanese adult citizens over 18 years of age toward science and
   technology. A theoretical model is constructed and evaluated to identify
   factors that affect public attitudes. Differences in citizens' gender,
   age, and educational level are also examined to determine whether they
   parallel differences found in their attitudes. Citizens were selected
   using probability proportional to size (PPS) sampling. A total of 2,024
   valid questionnaires were collected and analyzed by structural equation
   modeling. The results showed that citizens' scientific knowledge
   promotes positive attitudes toward techno-scientific issues, which are
   reflected in their high level of support for scientific development,
   research and application, as well as recognition of global warming and
   impression of scientists. Additionally, citizens of different genders,
   ages, and educational levels have significant differences in their
   attitudes toward science and technology. Implications for formal and
   informal science education are discussed.},

Abstract = {Social responsibility campaigns as an approach to overcome accumulated
   social problems in the globalizing world will be examined from various
   aspects. Printed Media, mass media, electronic media will be explored in
   terms of their limitations and potentials. Problems/Issues identified in
   social responsibility campaigns, which have been the subject of both
   formal and informal communication and advertisement, will be analyzed
   from the aspects of design, creative strategy, target audience
   determination, processes, and results. Awareness phase in the social
   responsibility campaigns realized with the cooperation of advertising
   agencies and public and private sectors and non-governmental
   organisations will be examined in terms of problem determination,
   creative ideas, creative strategic design processes, solution
   suggestions, its reflection to the society, creating, consciousness
   phase and its implications. Themes chosen in social responsibility
   campaigns are global warming, women's rights, dimensions of domestic and
   social violence, preservation of nature and environment, education of
   girls, etc.},

Title = {Lake highstands on the Altiplano (Tropical Andes) contemporaneous with

Abstract = {This study provides new geochronological and stable isotope constraints
   on Late Pleistocene fluctuations in lake level that occurred in the
   closed-watershed of the Central Altiplano between similar to 25 and
   similar to 12 ka. U-series isochrons and C-14 ages from carbonates are
   used to confirm and refine the previous chronology published (Placzek et
   al., 2006b). Our new data support three successive lake highstands
   during the Late Pleistocene: (i) the lake Sajsi cycle, from similar to
   25 to 19 ka, that culminated at 3670 m at about 22 ka, almost
   synchronously with the global last glacial maximum, (ii) the Lake Tauca
   cycle, that lasted from 18 to 14.5 ka and was characterized by the
   highest water level, reached at least 3770 m from 16.5 to 15 ka, (iii)
   the Lake Coipasa cycle, from 12.5 to 11.9 ka, that reached an elevation
   of similar to 3700 m, 42 m above the elevation of the Salar de Uyuni
   (3658 m). These high amplitude lake level fluctuations are in phase with
   the cold-warm oscillations that occurred in the North Atlantic and
   Greenland during the Late Pleistocene (Heinrich 1, Bolling-Allerod,
   Younger Dryas). Such temporal coincidence supports the hypothesis that
   wet events recorded in the Central Altiplano are controlled by the
   north-south displacement of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone
   resulting from changes in the meridional temperature gradient. Finally,
   the oxygen isotope ratios measured in these lacustrine carbonates allows
   for calculation of the delta O-18 value of paleolake waters. Estimates
   of water delta O-18 (V-SMOW) are -2.8 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand for
   Lake Tauca and -1.6 +/- 0.9 parts per thousand, for Lake Coipasa. These
   data are used to constrain changes in lake hydrology and can be
   interpreted to indicate that the proportion of precipitation arising
   from local water recycling was less than 50\%. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Framing environmental sustainability challenges for research and
   innovation in European policy agendas},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {14},
Number = {8},

Abstract = {Recent EU policy has linked research agendas with societal challenges,
   which has resulted in an increased emphasis on the need for exchange of
   knowledge between research and non-research actors, especially civil
   society organisations. Concurrent with this, has been a call for
   democratic accountability of research agendas and science that addresses
   Grand Societal Challenges. The challenge of environmental sustainability
   features strongly in these discussions with an emphasis on global
   warming, the tightening of energy, water and food supplies, and the
   overarching goal of achieving an `eco-efficient economy'. However, this
   challenge can be defined in various ways, with different definitions
   orienting towards different solutions many of which we argue may be
   contradictory to the goal of environmental sustainability. In this
   commentary we illustrate how dominant research agendas are often
   orientated towards the partisan agendas of influential stakeholders,
   favouring myopic technological fixes and marginalising other civil
   society actors and critical insights from social science. Our main
   recommendations include a more dominant role for social sciences,
   involving civil society more actively in research agenda setting,
   increased communication, information sharing and capacity building, and
   increased interdisciplinarity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Key terms such as Global warming, Green House Gas emissions, or Energy
   efficiency are currently on the scope of scientific research. Regarding
   telecommunications networks, wireless applications, routing protocols,
   etc. are being designed following this new ``Green{''} trend. This work
   contributes to the evaluation of the environmental impact of networks
   from physical interconnection point of view. Networks deployment, usage,
   and disposal are analyzed as contributing elements to ICT's (Information
   and Communications Technology) CO2 emissions. This paper presents an
   analytical model for evaluating and quantifying the CO2 emissions of
   optical backbone networks during their lifetime. The main goal of this
   work is to present the model and illustrate how to evaluate the physical
   interconnection of backbones from an environmental perspective. This
   model can be applied as a new type of decision support criteria for
   backbone's interconnection, since minimization of CO2 emissions is
   becoming an important factor. In addition, two case studies are
   presented to illustrate the use and application of this model, and the
   need for de facto and international standards to reduce CO2 emissions
   through good network planning. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Information services for European pork chains - Closing gaps in

Journal = {COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {79},
Number = {2},
Pages = {125-136},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Several global developments (e.g. diminishing production resources,
   growing demand for bio-energy) and numerous sector-wide crises (e.g.
   BSE, swine fever, dioxin) have led to a changing attitude of society
   towards the consequences of the food systems activities for social,
   economic and environmental issues, captured in the term of
   sustainability. Consumers in their role as final customers, and as a
   consequence also enterprises within agri-food supply chains, show
   increasing interest in the characteristics of food, and in turn, on the
   availability of related information and guarantees. Enterprises in
   agri-food supply chains are facing new expectations and are seeking to
   communicate social, economic and environmental performance of their
   business to customers within their supply chain and to consumers. New
   solutions for determination and communication of sustainability are
   needed for the agri-food sector, covering single aspects of
   sustainability as well as sustainability in a broader sense, including
   social, economic and environmental issues. Integrated, computer-based
   information services, since they are mainly building on existing
   systems, provide flexible solutions for enterprises to measure and
   evaluate sustainability of products throughout agri-food supply chains.
   Gained information on product characteristics might be used for decision
   support within enterprises as well as for communication of sustainable
   practices to customers and consumers, resulting in increased
   competitiveness of enterprises, supply chains and the sector by
   satisfying customers' and consumers' demands for information on the
   sustainability of a product. The present paper introduces a framework
   for developing information services for European pork chains using the
   three selected information domains food safety (representing social
   sustainability), quality (representing economic sustainability) and
   global warming potential (representing environmental sustainability).
   Resulting information models give an aggregated overview on information
   availability and exchange in European pork chains, additional
   information demands of possible service users and deficiencies in the
   existing information infrastructures. The paper supports different
   stakeholders involved in agri-food production, such as service
   developers, enterprise decision makers and management consultants, in
   developing enterprise- and chain-specific solutions which meet
   customers' and consumers' demands by providing appropriate
   sustainability information and guarantees. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The monitoring of global lightning activity and its spatial and temporal
   variations is known to be very essential for the study of global
   warming, the subject of greatest concern to human beings on planet Earth
   today. As a method of remote sensing for the global lightning
   distribution, we have proposed an inverse problem by using the data of
   natural electromagnetic noise in the ELF (extremely low frequency)
   Schumann resonance (SR) band observed simultaneously at a few stations
   around the world. The fundamentals of this inversion problem (or ELF
   tomography) to the SR data have been presented and the first attempt to
   deduce the global lightning distribution by means of the real SR data
   has been performed, which has indicated a possibility of snapshots of
   well-known thunderstorm centers on the globe. This ELF tomography
   consists of two stages. The first stage is the inversion of the ELF
   field power spectra to the distribution of lightning intensity by
   distance relative to an observation point. The obtained distance
   profiles of intensity of sources at a few stations are used as
   tomographic projections for reconstructing a spatial distribution of
   sources in the second stage. Maps of the global lightning distributions
   constructed by the result of inversions of ELF background field spectra
   obtained from three stations around the world show that the most active
   regions vary meridionally on the diurnal time scale being connected
   mainly with continental areas in the tropics. We do hope that this kind
   of inversion method to multi-stationed ELF data will be of great
   importance in the future.},

Title = {Emotions, Trust, and Perceived Risk: Affective and Cognitive Routes to
   Flood Preparedness Behavior},
Journal = {RISK ANALYSIS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {31},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1658-1675},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Despite the prognoses of the effects of global warming (e.g., rising sea
   levels, increasing river discharges), few international studies have
   addressed how flood preparedness should be stimulated among private
   citizens. This article aims to predict Dutch citizens' flood
   preparedness intentions by testing a path model, including previous
   flood hazard experiences, trust in public flood protection, and flood
   risk perceptions (both affective and cognitive components). Data were
   collected through questionnaire surveys in two coastal communities (n =
   169, n = 244) and in one river area community (n = 658). Causal
   relations were tested by means of structural equation modeling (SEM).
   Overall, the results indicate that both cognitive and affective
   mechanisms influence citizens' preparedness intentions. First, a higher
   level of trust reduces citizens' perceptions of flood likelihood, which
   in turn hampers their flood preparedness intentions (cognitive route).
   Second, trust also lessens the amount of dread evoked by flood risk,
   which in turn impedes flood preparedness intentions (affective route).
   Moreover, the affective route showed that levels of dread were
   especially influenced by citizens' negative and positive emotions
   related to their previous flood hazard experiences. Negative emotions
   most often reflected fear and powerlessness, while positive emotions
   most frequently reflected feelings of solidarity. The results are
   consistent with the affect heuristic and the historical context of Dutch
   flood risk management. The great challenge for flood risk management is
   the accommodation of both cognitive and affective mechanisms in risk
   communications, especially when most people lack an emotional basis
   stemming from previous flood hazard events.},

   Insights into Distal Effects Induced by the Mutations},

Abstract = {Networks and clusters of intramolecular interactions, as well as their
   ``communication{''} across the three-dimensional architecture have a
   prominent role in determining protein stability and function. Special
   attention has been dedicated to their role in thermal adaptation. In the
   present contribution, seven previously experimentally characterized
   mutants of a cold-adapted alpha-amylase, featuring mesophilic-like
   behavior, have been investigated by multiple molecular dynamics
   simulations, essential dynamics and analyses of correlated motions and
   electrostatic interactions. Our data elucidate the molecular mechanisms
   underlying the ability of single and multiple mutations to globally
   modulate dynamic properties of the cold-adapted alpha-amylase, including
   both local and complex unpredictable distal effects. Our investigation
   also shows, in agreement with the experimental data, that the conversion
   of the cold-adapted enzyme in a warm-adapted variant cannot be
   completely achieved by the introduction of few mutations, also providing
   the rationale behind these effects. Moreover, pivotal residues, which
   are likely to mediate the effects induced by the mutations, have been
   identified from our analyses, as well as a group of suitable candidates
   for protein engineering. In fact, a subset of residues here identified
   (as an isoleucine, or networks of mesophilic-like salt bridges in the
   proximity of the catalytic site) should be considered, in experimental
   studies, to get a more efficient modification of the features of the
   cold-adapted enzyme.},

Abstract = {During April 2009, a novel H1N1 influenza A virus strain was identified
   in Mexico and the USA. Within weeks the virus had spread globally and
   the first pandemic of the 21st Century had been declared. It is unlikely
   to be the last and it is crucial that real lessons are learned from the
   experience. Asia is considered a hot spot for the emergence of new
   pathogens including past influenza pandemics. On this occasion while
   preparing for an avian, highly virulent influenza virus (H5N1 like)
   originating in Asia in fact the pandemic originated from swine, and was
   less virulent. This discrepancy between what was planned for and what
   emerged created its own challenges. The H1N1 pandemic has tested
   national health-care infrastructures and exposed shortcomings in our
   preparedness as a region. Key health challenges include communication
   throughout the region, surge capacity, access to reliable information
   and access to quality care, healthcare worker skills, quality, density
   and distribution, access to essential medicines and lack of
   organizational infrastructure for emergency response. Despite years of
   preparation the public health and clinical research community were not
   ready to respond and opportunities for an immediate research response
   were missed. Despite warm words and pledges efforts to engage the
   international community to ensure equitable sharing of limited resources
   such as antivirals and vaccines fell short and stockpiles in the main
   remained in the rich world. This manuscript with authors from across the
   region describes some of the major challenges faced by Asia in response
   to the pandemic and draws lessons for the future.},

Title = {Environmental assessment of cod (Gadus morhua) from autoline fisheries},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {7},
Pages = {611-624},

Abstract = {Purpose The main purpose of this study has been to document the
   environmental performance of products based on autoline-caught cod and
   the distribution of environmental impacts in the value chain from
   fishing to retail. Another aim has been to document the performed
   environmental improvement analyses.
   Methods Standard life cycle assessment methodology has been employed and
   the following impact categories studied: global warming potential (GWP),
   acidification, eutrophication, photochemical oxidant formation, ozone
   layer depletion and cumulative energy demand.
   Results and discussion Products derived from autoline-caught cod have a
   GWP in the range of 0.16-7.6/1.7-4.4 kg CO2-eq/kg product delivered to
   consumer, using economic and mass allocation, respectively. The main
   impacts come from fuel consumption and release of refrigerants in the
   fishery. The products studied represent each of the four major
   processing outputs. The differences between the products can partly be
   attributed to differences in methodology (system borders, allocation),
   partly to actual physical differences. A comparison with published
   results from other studies indicates that seafood products sourced from
   Northeast Arctic cod fished with the autoline method has a relatively
   good environmental performance. A number of possible options for
   improving the environmental performance of the products were identified.
   The most internal improvement action was stopping leakages in fish
   freezers.
   Conclusions This study has given a detailed overview of the
   environmental performance of seafood products sourced from Northeast
   Arctic cod from autoline fisheries in Norwegian territorial waters. This
   study has demonstrated the usefulness of such results in improving the
   environmental performance of the products. However, the usefulness of
   the results in communication to external actors is limited because few
   data exists on other products fulfilling the same functions and using
   the exact same methodology and assumptions. In order to achieve
   comparability between results from competing products, it is necessary
   to use a standardised and detailed calculation method. At the moment, no
   such method seems to be available. The literature study indicated that
   the environmental impact of Northeast Arctic cod products sourced from
   autoline fisheries compares well with other cod products on the market.
   Some cod stocks are sustainably managed, others not. Hence, it is
   recommended to break down results not only to species level but also
   fish stock level when the aim is to guide seafood customers towards
   making informed purchasing decisions.},

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Carbon dioxide capture from point sources like coal-fired power plants
   is considered to be a solution for stabilizing the CO2 level in the
   atmosphere to avoid global warming. Methane is an important energy
   source that is often highly diluted by nitrogen in natural gas. For the
   separation of CO2 and CH4 from N-2 in flue gas and natural gas,
   respectively, sorbents with high and reversible gas uptake, high gas
   selectivity, good chemical and thermal stability, and low cost are
   desired. Here we report the synthesis and CO2, CH4, and N-2 adsorption
   properties of hierarchically porous electron-rich covalent
   organonitridic frameworks (PECONFs). These were prepared by simple
   condensation reactions between inexpensive, commercially available
   nitridic and electron-rich aromatic building units. The PECONF materials
   exhibit high and reversible CO2 and CH4 uptake and exceptional
   selectivities of these gases over N-2. The materials do not oxidize in
   air up to temperature of 400 degrees C.},

Title = {Long-term projections and acclimatization scenarios of
   temperature-related mortality in Europe},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The steady increase in greenhouse gas concentrations is inducing a
   detectable rise in global temperatures. The sensitivity of human
   societies to warming temperatures is, however, a transcendental question
   not comprehensively addressed to date. Here we show the link between
   temperature, humidity and daily numbers of deaths in nearly 200 European
   regions, which are subsequently used to infer transient projections of
   mortality under state-of-the-art high-resolution greenhouse gas scenario
   simulations. Our analyses point to a change in the seasonality of
   mortality, with maximum monthly incidence progressively shifting from
   winter to summer. The results also show that the rise in heat-related
   mortality will start to completely compensate the reduction of deaths
   from cold during the second half of the century, amounting to an average
   drop in human lifespan of up 3-4 months in 2070-2100. Nevertheless,
   projections suggest that human lifespan might indeed increase if a
   substantial degree of adaptation to warm temperatures takes place.},

Abstract = {Man's quest to get into space is hindered by major problems (e.g.,
   system-development and capital costs, expense of putting mass into
   orbit, trapped-radiation belts, and environmental impact of a large
   increase in rocket launches). A multi-purpose low-earth-orbit system of
   rings circling the earth - the ``LEO ARCHIPELAGO (TM){''} - is proposed
   as a means of solving or bypassing many of them. A fiber-optic ring
   about the earth would be an initial testing and developmental stage for
   the Ring Systems, while providing cash-flow through a LEO-based,
   high-band-width, world-wide communication system. A
   low-earth-orbit-based space-elevator system, ``Sling-on-a-Ringrm
   (TM){''}, is proposed as the crucial developmental stage of the LEO
   Archipelago. Being a LEO-based heavy-mass lifter, rather than earth-or
   GEO-based, it is much less massive and therefore less costly than other
   proposed space-elevators. With the advent of lower-cost, higher-mass
   transport to orbit, the options for further space development (e.g.,
   space solar power, radiation, and space-debris dampers, sun shades, and
   permanent LEO habitation) are greatly expanded.
   This paper provides an update of the Sling-on-a-Ring concept in terms of
   new materials, potential applications, and trade-oil's associated with
   an earlier model. The impact of Colossal Carbon Tubes, CCT, a new
   material with high tensile strength, extremely-low density, and other
   favorable properties, and other new technologies (e.g., solar-powered
   lasers, power beaming to near-space and earth, and thermal-control
   systems) on the development of associated LEO-Ring systems is also
   explored. The material's effect on the timeline for the system
   development indicates the feasibility of near-term implementation of the
   system (possibly within the decade). The Sling-on-a-Ring can provide a
   less-expensive, environment-friendly mode of access to space. This would
   pave the way (via eventual operation at > 1000 t per day by 2050) for
   large scale development of space-based technologies. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {Solar PV is widely considered as a ``green{''} technology. This paper,
   however, investigates the environmental impact of the production of
   solar modules made from thin-film silicon. We focus on novel
   applications of nano-crystalline Silicon materials (nc-Si) into current
   amorphous Silicon (a-Si) devices. Two nc-Si specific details concerning
   the environmental performance can be identified, when we want to compare
   to a-Si modules. First, in how far the extra (and thicker) silicon layer
   (s) affects upstream material requirements and energy use. Second, in
   how far depositing an extra silicon layer may increase emissions of
   greenhouse gases as additional emissions of Fluor gases (F-gases) are
   associated to this step. The much larger global warming potential of
   F-gases (17 200-22 800 times that of CO2) may lead to higher
   environmental burdens. To date, no study has yet analyzed the effect of
   F-gas usage on the environmental profile of thin-film silicon solar
   modules. We performed a life-cycle assessment (LCA) to investigate the
   current environmental usefulness of pursuing this novel micromorph
   concept. The switch to the new micromorph technology will result in a
   60-85\% increase in greenhouse gas emissions (per generated kWh solar
   electricity) in case of NF3 based clean processing, and 15-100\% when
   SF6 is used. We conclude that F-gas usage has a substantial
   environmental impact on both module types, in particular the micromorph
   one. Also, micromorph module efficiencies need to be improved from the
   current 8-9\% (stabilized efficiency) toward 12-16\% (stab. eff.) in
   order to compensate for the increased environmental impacts. Copyright

Abstract = {Control of CO(2) emissions, which are the main factor causing global
   warming, is one of the most important problems in the 21st century for
   the preservation of the earth's environment. Therefore, efficient supply
   and use of energy are indispensable. We have proposed distributed energy
   management systems (DEMS), which are intended to obtain optimal plans
   that minimize both costs and CO(2) emissions by electrical and thermal
   trading. In this paper we evaluate trading methods for the DEMS through

Abstract = {Space weather is a relatively new and important field of research. It is
   relevant to diverse topics such as radio communication, space travel,
   diagnostics of ionospheric and space plasmas, detection of pollutants
   and re-entry objects, prediction of terrestrial weather and global
   warming. Recently it has been shown that nano- and micrometre-sized
   electrically charged particulates from interplanetary space and from the
   Earth's atmosphere can affect the local properties as well as the
   diagnostics of the interplanetary, magnetospheric, ionospheric and
   terrestrial complex plasmas. In this report the sources of the charged
   dust particulates and the effects of the latter on the near-Earth space
   weather are examined.},

Abstract = {For governments and for manufacturing companies, global warming, rising
   energy prices, and customers' increasing ecological awareness have
   pushed energy efficient manufacturing to the top of the agenda.
   Governments and companies are both striving to identify the most
   effective measures to increase energy efficiency in manufacturing
   processes. Based on results of a recent EU-funded road-mapping project,
   this paper highlights the needs of industrial companies for integrating
   energy efficiency performance in production management. First, it
   analyses concepts and tools for measurement, control and improvement of
   energy efficiency in production management proposed in literature.
   Second, the paper outlines that ICT tools and standardization are
   important enablers for energy efficient manufacturing. Third, industrial
   needs in these areas are presented based on expert interviews. The
   industrial needs thus identified are contrasted with concepts proposed
   in literature to point out the implementation gaps between practice and
   theory. The paper demonstrates that there exists a gap between the
   solutions available and the actual implementation in industrial
   companies. It concludes by deriving requirements for energy management
   in production that future collaborative research projects should

Title = {Southern Ocean wind response to North Atlantic cooling and the rise in
   atmospheric CO2: Modeling perspective and paleoceanographic implications},

Abstract = {A recent study found enhanced upwelling rates in the Southern Ocean
   during the last glacial termination that coincided with the deglacial
   warming in Antarctica and the rise in atmospheric CO2. They hypothesized
   that the intensification of Southern Hemisphere midlatitude westerlies,
   the presumed cause of the increased wind-driven upwelling, was triggered
   by an initial cooling within the glacial North Atlantic whose influence
   was then communicated to the southern midlatitudes through an
   atmospheric teleconnection. In this study, we explore the viability of
   the above hypothesis using a modeling strategy, focusing on the
   atmospheric teleconnection. In simulations where North Atlantic cooling
   was applied, the model Intertropical Convergence Zone shifted southward,
   and westerlies and wind stress over Southern Ocean increased by as much
   as 25\%. While the perennial westerly anomalies occur over the entire
   Southern Ocean, they are strongest over the South Pacific during the
   austral winter. When the wind stress anomalies were applied to an Earth
   system model incorporating interactive marine biogeochemistry,
   atmospheric CO2 rises between 20 and 60 ppm, depending on the biological
   response. We thus confirm the viability of the proposed atmospheric
   teleconnection hypothesis. The teleconnection appears to involves two
   distinct steps: first, the North Atlantic cooling shifts the
   Intertropical Convergence Zone southward, weakening the southern branch
   of the Hadley circulation, and second, how the altered Hadley
   circulation in turn modifies the structure of midlatitude westerlies in
   the South Pacific, via the former's influence on the Southern Hemisphere
   subtropical jet. This study underscores the control of the Northern
   Hemisphere has on southern midlatitude westerlies, mediating by tropical
   circulation, in contrast to past paleoclimate hypotheses that the
   magnitude and position of the southern midlatitude westerlies was
   controlled by global mean temperature. Our results do not preclude other
   potential mechanisms for affecting Southern Ocean ventilation, in
   particular through oceanic pathways. Citation: Lee, S.-Y., J. C. H.

Abstract = {Models of photosynthesis mimetic systems, the so-called artificial
   photosynthesis systems, have been investigated since the 1970s for the
   purpose of tapping solar energy. With the deterioration of the global
   environment in the 21st century, attributed to global warming and
   greenhouse gas emissions, it has become imperative to identify new fuel
   sources such as solar energy to replace fossil fuels. Among the new fuel
   production systems, those involving the use of solar energy have
   attracted attention; examples are systems that produce hydrogen through
   water photolysis and those that produce methanol by CO2 reduction with
   the aid of an artificial photosynthesis system. As hydrogen and methanol
   are low-carbon fuels (the emission of CO2 from the combustion of these
   fuels is low), they are considered to be alternatives to fossil
   resources. In this review, solar fuel production systems consisting of
   an artificial photosynthesis system, a catalyst, and an enzyme are
   discussed. These systems are expected to help in reducing CO2 and to
   promote the use of low-carbon fuels in the future.},

Abstract = {In this paper the new prediction method based on analysis of the
   integrated (cumulative) curves is suggested. This method includes the
   procedure of the optimal linear smoothing (POLS) for the finding of
   optimal trends, independent ``reading{''} of relative fluctuations in
   terms of beta-distribution function that are formed after subtraction of
   the calculated trend and the recognition of the proper fitting
   hypothesis for the integrated optimal trends by the eigen-coordinates
   method. The combined noninvasive approach was applied to analysis of
   temperature data obtained from the site
   http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/ related to the global warming (GW)
   phenomenon. These data are considered as nontrivial examples of
   verification of new forecasting method. The available data were combined
   into six files covering the mean/anomalous temperature 1546 month's
   points covering the period from the January of 1880 up to October of
   2008. Besides the global registered points the combined files included
   in themselves the north/south data points measured independently for
   both the Earth's hemispheres. The combined new method (preliminary
   verified on mimic data) applied to these files predicts the changing of
   the GW period by the global cooling (GC) period that will happen during
   the years 2038-2136. Besides this important result a new method helps to
   discover the influence of a small but stable oscillating process with a
   set of self-similar periods Omega(n) = Omega(0)xi(n), n = 0, +/- 1, +/-
   2, +/- 3, +/- 4 with mean period < T > = 12.55 year. This fact should
   present interest for ecologists and meteorologists working in this
   field. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {When it comes to environmental sustainability, opinions often run deep.
   In one extreme are people that believe humans have not, nor can they, do
   anything to the earth that will jeopardize its future. The other extreme
   blames humanity for all of earth's woes: global warming, melting ice
   caps, dying species, etc. In between these two extremes are a mass of
   people that are not sure what to believe. Environmental sites,
   therefore, want to encourage activism and promote their message in the
   most effective way possible.
   The purpose of this study will be to look at these environmental sites
   and determine
   The intended message of the site
   The intended design theme
   If the intended message and design theme are well matched
   A well-designed site will have a design theme that matches the intended
   message of the prose. This alignment of design and information will
   create the best experience for the viewer, and would drive the
   environmental sites purposes further.
   This paper will use a model of visual form/visual purpose connections
   based on the semiotic of C. S. Peirce. This paper will take his approach
   and apply it to environmental web site design and report on the
   effectiveness of these site's overall design purposes.},

Title = {Ranking Objects Using Fuzzy Orders, with an Application to Refrigerants},
Journal = {MATCH-COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL AND IN COMPUTER CHEMISTRY},

Pages = {581-603},
Abstract = {Ranking objects means pairwise comparing their features, mostly using
   certain parameters, for example real-valued functions, the values of
   which allow to put the objects in a certain order. However, due to the
   ordinal character of ranking not all slight numerical differences in the
   values of features should be considered as relevant. The possible
   appearance of data noise may support the idea to robustify the order
   relations. For this reason, elements of fuzzy order theory are used in
   the present paper that allow stepwise to relax the requirements on the
   influence of numerical differences of feature values. The methods
   described are applied to the ranking of refrigerants based upon their
   ozone depletion potential, global warming potential and atmospheric
   lifetime. It is found that trifluoroiodomethane, dimethyl ether and
   ammonia are the least environmentally problematic substances for a wide
   range of relaxation in their environmental properties.
   Pentafluorodimethyl ether, mooted as replacement of problematic
   refrigerants, turns out to be a problematic substance for different
   levels of data relaxation, which raises questions regarding its
   environmental impact.},

Abstract = {The growth in energy consumption followed with global warming provides
   new topics and issues in communication systems known as green radio.
   Hence, how to reduce power consumption while meeting system throughput
   requirement is an urgent task. In this paper, we investigate a new
   cooperative power allocation scheme for a multi-user orthogonal
   frequency division multiplex (OFDM) system, in which two coordinated
   transmission points (CTP) jointly allocate their power to multiple
   orthogonal subchannels. In order to minimize the overall transmit power
   consumption while meeting the system total throughput requirement and
   also each CTP's power constraint, we formulate the objective task into a
   constrained optimization problem and derived a group of closed form
   power allocation solutions. The solutions turn out to take the form of
   traditional water-filling (WF) and also have a cooperative feature.
   Based on the derived solution, a novel power allocation algorithm with
   joint minimization power consumption (JMPC-PA) is proposed. Numerical
   results are presented to verify the optimality of the derived scheme.
   Considering the flexibility of CTP's category, e. g., base station or
   relay station, it is known that the derived scheme can be valid for any
   coordinated networks such as next-generation cellular networks or ad-hoc
   networks.},

Abstract = {``No Impact Man'' (NIM) Colin Beavan attracted international media
   attention and a good deal of criticism for his year-long experiment
   attempting to live making zero net impact on the environment. Whereas
   Beavan's critics dismissed the project as a mere publicity stunt, this
   essay reads the NIM blog, book, and documentary film as a compelling
   performance of green identity in the comic frame. This performance-which
   links private consumption to ecology and community, and emphasizes
   flaws, foibles, humor and humility-offers an appealing invitation to
   engage in both individual and collective action. I argue that comedy is
   a useful rhetorical tool for addressing global warming, as it enables us
   to see ourselves not as helpless victims in a tragic doomsday scenario,
   but as imperfect actors who are both guilty contributors to the problem
   and agents responsible for its amelioration.},

   constructed in order to examine the greenhouse effect on the
   sustainability of human population as well as the environmental tax when
   the sustainability is in danger. The conclusion of this paper is that
   when the negative effect is small, the tax can guarantee the
   sustainability, where the effective tax rate interval for the
   sustainability shrinks as the negative effect rises. When the negative
   effect exceeds the critical level, however, the environmental tax cannot
   guarantee the sustainability of human population. Thus, the remedial
   measure to reduce the greenhouse effect other than the environmental tax
   is needed for the sustainability.},

Abstract = {Saving energy is indispensable in the solving of environmental problems
   such as global warming and resource depletion. In the household and
   office sectors, which are growing in terms of electric power
   consumption, it is desired to improve the efficiency of air conditioning
   because power consumption due to air conditioning is dominant
   particularly in summer when conditions of electricity usage are tight.
   However, the drawback with the excessive reduction in power consumption
   is the consequent reduction in indoor comfort levels and working
   efficiency. Therefore, it is important to reduce power consumption with
   comfort in mind. In our study, we carry out experiments on environmental
   measurement and control of an air conditioner by using the Keio
   university network oriented intelligent and versatile energy saving
   system (KNIVES). Three different control methods are used for evaluation
   of power consumption. The first method involves ON/OFF control of the
   air conditioner through its demand control terminal; this method is
   widely used. The second method involves infrared control in changing the
   temperature of the air conditioner by means of automatic infrared
   signals. The thirds method involves inverter control that changes the
   inverter power output of the air conditioner by using a special demand
   control unit. Power consumption and comfort are compared and evaluated
   for each of the three methods.},

Abstract = {The growth in energy demand coupled with global warming provide new
   trends in communication systems known as green radio. The main focus in
   green radio is to provide new techniques to save energy consumption. In
   this paper, a new concept, named ultra wide time (UWT), is proposed to
   define the lower asymptotic consumed energy to transmit a given amount
   of information. With UWT concept, minimization of energy consumption
   leads to infinite time of transmission. To overcome this drawback, and
   instead of energy minimization, we proposed to evaluate the energetic
   performance of communication systems with a new energy efficiency beta,
   defined as the ratio between the asymptotic limit and the consumed
   energy. It is then possible to control the energetic consumption with
   finite time of transmission. The energy efficiency beta is fixed in
   advance and the transmitter is then configured under this constraint.
   Both UWT and energy efficiency beta are applied in parallel channel with
   best effort communications. Simulation results show that energetic gains
   of 20 dB can be reached in WiMAX configuration. This respects the ``two
   order of magnitude lower transmission power{''} mentioned by the
   Wireless World Research Forum.},

Abstract = {The Source Region of the Yangtze River locates in the Qinghai-Tibet
   Plateau with an area of 142299 km(2), which is especially sensitive to
   global warming because of its high elevation and cold environment. To
   assess the land use and land cover changes from 1975 to 2005, we
   employed remote sensing and GIS technology to monitor the area of land
   use and land cover at four times (1975, 1990, 2000, and 2005). The data
   sources included Landsat multi-spectral scanner (MSS) images acquired in
   1975 with an 80-m spatial resolution, Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+)
   images acquired in 2000 with a 30-m resolution, and Thematic Mapper (TM)
   images acquired in 1990 and 2005 with a 30-m spatial resolution. The
   monitoring result shows that, the study area experienced an overall
   environmental degradation between 1975 and 2005. The environmental
   degradation includes deforestation, grassland degradation and sandy land
   expansion.},

Abstract = {Nowadays the world faces the global warming crisis, and countries all
   over the world are trying to develop low-carbon economy. It is a huge
   challenge for China to change from the traditional economy mode into a
   low-carbon economy mode. This paper puts forward that it is urgent to
   develop low-carbon economy for China by comparing the ``total energy
   consumption{''} with the ``ten thousand yuan of energy consumption{''}.
   Results manifested that it was necessary for our country to go the
   Chinese characteristic road of low-carbon economy with the foundation of
   low energy consumption and pollution, which was guided by the scientific
   development concept, adhere to the principle of sustainable development.
   This paper established a development pattern and mechanism of low-carbon
   economy for China, and analysed the pattern from three aspects of
   development direction, mode and method. We put forward some suggestions
   in the end to well develop a low-carbon economic society.},

Abstract = {Malaysia is among the lowest emitters of CO, compared to most
   industrialized countries, as reported in the National Communication 1994
   to UNFCCC. Nevertheless, cement industries in Malaysia are under
   increasing regulatory pressures to reduce their emissions and contribute
   more aggressively to mitigating global warming. This paper examines some
   of the conventional and potential policy mechanisms for greenhouse gas
   emissions and analyzes their advantages and drawbacks. The
   applicability, effectiveness and potential impact of these policy
   mechanisms for the global cement industry in general, and the Malaysian
   cement industry in particular, are discussed with recommendations for
   possible courses of action. These recommendations should be in line with
   the government's own commitment to ensure sustainable development and
   should have due regard for the necessary social responsibility to
   protect the environment. Furthermore, this article discusses the
   development of the cement industry in Malaysia and the resulting changes
   in CO, emissions, and explores the drivers for these changes. The
   sources of CO, emissions in the cement industry are presented, as well
   as a discussion of potential ways to reduce Malaysian cement industry
   emissions even further, particularly through the use of agrowaste as raw
   materials for cement production.},

Abstract = {Recently. with the increasing of the interest about global warming,
   pollutions and so on, a number of distributed generations (DGs) such as
   photovoltaic (PV) and wind power (WP) are interconnected with
   distribution systems. However, installing of DGs makes power flow
   changes such as directions, one-direction to hi-direction, and
   increasing/decreasing of fault current. Therefore, it may cause the
   critical problems. This paper proposes an evaluation algorithm for
   bi-directional protection coordination and presents an evaluation system
   for protection coordination based on the algorithm. By performing
   simulations, the result shows that the existing method may cause
   critical problems, and also the effectiveness of proposed method is
   verified.},

Abstract = {This document presents the New Operational SYstem for the Control of
   Aerostats (NOSYCA). This new system uses IP for the board to ground
   interface allowing implementation of new payload operations concepts.
   CNES has been launching for a long time different types of stratospheric
   balloons in order to allow the scientific community to study the
   atmosphere or to realize astronomical observations. This kind of vehicle
   is particularly adapted for the measurements, the characterizations, and
   the modeling that the scientists have to realize in the present period
   of global warming. Of course, the operators of balloons have to protect
   the over flown populations.
   In this context it is necessary to have an at once very versatile
   payload TT\&C architecture, and a reliable and safe command / control
   system.
   Mindful of the need to protect of goods, persons and environment the
   CNES decided, in 2007, to carry out the development of a New Operational
   System for the Control of Aerostats named NOSYCA.
   This new system takes into account:
   - More than 40 years experience of stratospheric balloon operations at
   different latitudes (Polar, Mediterranean and Equatorial flights).
   - The heritage of last flights where CNES's developments were tested :
   low consumption transceivers, Programmable Logic Controllers for Iridium
   and Inmarsat communication management, TCP/IP routers, renewable energy
   systems, payload scientist on-board interface,...
   This ambitious development demonstrates the willingness of CNES to
   provide the scientific community with a very reliable and
   high-performance system.},

Abstract = {The Kurihara Green ICT Project is aimed to create ``symbiosis between
   our daily life and nature via information communication technology
   (ICT).{''} This is a Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications
   project of Japan, with a budget of 250 million yen for year 2010 and
   Professor Norio Shiratori is serving as the project leader.
   Our goal is to conduct a real-world experiment in the community based
   field to test the technical specification of necessary communication
   protocol, to realize network integrated control system aimed at
   community development to reduce environmental burden in the wide-area
   distributed community. We are also considering international
   standardization of our proposed protocols. Two themes have been
   discussed, which will be achieved by the symbiosis between natural
   environment and human by integration of wide-area distributed community.
   Theme-1 is an integrated system to ensure seamless communication among
   heterogenous networks in a wide-area distributed community/offices.
   Theme-2 is an efficient network management system for reducing
   environmental burden of wide-area distributed community. Kurihara city,
   situated in northern Japan, is our experimental field, selected as our
   demonstration area because of its special characteristics. Human
   inhabitants of Kurihara are scattered around the entire city area
   including some in mountainous places. The sub-offices of this city are
   also far from each other. For these above features, it is considered as
   a perfect example of distributed system and so an ideal location to test
   our system.
   In view of the ongoing debate on global warming, among other developed
   countries, Japan's former prime minister Yukio Hatoyama pledged to
   reduce Green House Gas (GHG) emission by 25\% by year 2020. To achieve
   such an ambitious goal, in a symbiosis society a cooperative coexistence
   of human and information technology is very much essential. In this
   paper, we describe our project's concept and initial experimental result
   for human-nature symbiosis.},

Abstract = {Green growth or green management practices originating from advanced
   countries proliferated worldwide during the 2000s. According to the Low
   Carbon, Green Growth Act announced by the government of South Korea in
   April 2010, business should gradually adopt an environmental management
   system (EMS) to efficiently use resources and energy and to minimize the
   emission of greenhouse gas or other pollutants as a result of business
   activities. In addition, businesses should acknowledge social and
   ethical responsibilities. Environmental management systems were
   introduced in Korea as a competitive strategy in the early 1990s, and
   have increased in Korea since 2003 under the influence of the
   product-related environmental regulations of European countries and the
   Korean government. Achieving the ISO 14001 standard requires an EMS
   system. This critical and authoritative certification system, legislated
   in 1996, directly connects to business reliability. The number of
   corporations with the ISO 14001 certification continues to increase,
   with over 223,000 cases worldwide in 2009 and a 300 percent increase
   internationally since 2005. Korea, with sixth largest number of
   certifications, had 7,843 certified corporations in 2009 (ICIN, 2010).
   Green management systems seem to be a requirement for competitive
   differentiation in the fashion industry. In the fashion market,
   environment-conscious designers and fashion brands all over the world
   have produced environmentally friendly fashions by using organic
   materials, recycled materials, or green designs, appealing to consumers.
   The fashion market has continued to grow in size by launching typical
   organic lines and eco-friendly brands. A similar tendency for green
   marketing strategies can be found in Korea. A significant number of
   Korean national brands produce clothes with organic cotton; well-being
   materials, such as charcoal, corn, or bamboo; and recycled textiles. In
   addition, several brands have promoted environmental campaigns and have
   contributed a certain portion of profits to environment-related
   organizations (Dong, 2010 Dong, K.H. (2010). Recently, fashion brands
   have extended green practices to obtain official eco-labels or to adopt
   environmental management systems.
   This study investigates the environmental management system of a
   specific fashion corporation and analyzes green marketing strategies
   with respect to the elements of an EMS. We collected data from articles,
   journals, the brand website, and interviews conducted in 2009. For the
   study, we selected the Kolon Group as a leading example of an
   eco-friendly organization among domestic companies. Among fourteen
   subsidiary companies, six, including the Kolon Industry, obtained ISO
   14001 certifications. The first Kolon fashion brand was KOLON SPORT in
   1973, and three sportswear brands were launched in 1980s. After taking
   over the Cambridge division in 2007 and merging with Cambridge Kolon in
   2009, Kolon Industry changed its name to Kolon Industry and Cambridge
   Kolon, which included 28 popular fashion brands. The companys fashion
   brands were divided into five categories: outdoor, sports \& golf (5
   brands), mens wear (10 brands), womens wear (2 brands), casual wear (2
   brands) and others (3 shoes \& 6 premium brands).
   The Kolon fashion division announced their business vision as Eco
   Fashion Innovator after FnC Kolon obtained ISO 14001 certification in
   June 2008 (Kang, 2009b Kang, H.M. (2009b). considering the environment
   as a core value for competitive strength. Kolon practices
   environment-conscious activities, from textile development to visual
   merchandising in retail locations (Jung, 2008 Jung, J.W. (2008). Kolon
   Industry and Cambridge Kolon also use eco-friendly goods production,
   socially responsible promotion, and a recycled packaging system.
   Except shoes and premium brand categories, typical fashion brands are
   actively participating in distinct green marketing practices and
   strategies. First, organic cotton goods produced through environmentally
   friendly processes are the most common green product strategy across
   brands, except golf wear. Second, the use of eco-friendly and
   biodegradable ingredients, such as bamboo, bean, charcoal, corn, or
   volcanic ash, is another strategy. Third, brands have used recycled PET
   (Polyethylene Terephthalate) bottles that decrease greenhouse gases.
   Fourth, brands have produced energy-effective products, named Cool Biz
   or Warm Biz, which can be classified as eco-friendly products. Fifth,
   brands have used natural dyeing products, such as polygonum indigo,
   charcoal, and pomegranate, as an eco-friendly strategy. In addition,
   trashion, a portmanteau word of trash and fashion, can be found in a
   casual brand, series. Finally, specific items, such as t-shirts or bags,
   deliver environmental messages as a communication tool. Outdoor sports
   brands seem to practice eco-friendly product strategies most actively.
   Sports brands have used organic cotton and the recycled PET bottles
   items, and mens wear included items with biodegradable ingredients as
   well as temperature-controlled suits.
   With respect to communication, the Kolon Group implemented diverse
   marketing communication strategies. For example, in 2010, Kolon made a
   three-year agreement with the Join Together Society NGO to donate 2- to
   3-year-old products in stock to third-world countries, amounting to five
   hundred million worth of stock each year. Outdoor sportswear brands
   practice green management the most thoroughly, whereas other brand
   categories apply green management to limited areas. Womens wear and
   casual wear usually engage in customer participation events.
   To maintain customers and to thrive in the ever-critical global market,
   it is time to take part in environmental business practices. To survive
   in the competitive market, it is imperative to establish a systematic
   tool to improve environmental performance and reduce the long-term
   environmental impacts of products, services, retailers, suppliers, and
   employees. Future green branding strategy should be responsible from
   social, ethical, and environmental perspectives.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an automated truck platoon that has been developed
   under a national ITS project named ``Energy ITS.{''} The project,
   started in 2008, aims at energy saving and global warming prevention
   with ITS technologies. A platoon of 3 fully-automated trucks currently
   drives at 80 km/h with the gap of 10 m on a test truck and along an
   expressway before public use, under not only steady state driving but
   also lane changing. The lateral control is based on the lane marker
   detection by the computer vision, and the longitudinal control is based
   on the gap measurement by 76 GHz radar and lidar in addition to the
   inter-vehicle communications of 5.8 GHz DSRC. The radar and lidar also
   work as the obstacle detection. The feature of the technologies is the
   high reliability, aiming at the near future introduction. Fuel
   consumption measurement on a test track and along an expressway shows
   that the fuel can be saved by about 14 \%. The evaluation simulation
   shows that the effectiveness of the platooning with the gap of 10 m when
   the 40 \% penetration in heavy trucks is 2.1 \% reduction of CO2 along
   an expressway. The introduction scenario is also discussed.},

Abstract = {decomposition are critical parts of the global carbon cycle. Now
   accurate estimation of the organic carbon pools and SOC decomposition of
   different land use types are extremely important for the government to
   establish appropriate policy for land use and to solve the severe issue
   of the global warming. On the basis of the three-pool first-order
   theory, we studied the influence of land use change on soil carbon pool
   in the typical karst area, Maocun, Guilin. The result showed that the
   total SOC contents of the cultivated land, the shrub, the orchard and
   the forest land were 15.4-20.10, 13.07-31.16, 9.38-14.74 and 30.82-37.52
   g/kg respectively. Ca pool of SOC is 1.01\%-2.46\%, with an average MRT
   of 25 days and Cs pool contents 12.81-45.79\% of SOC, with an average
   MRT of 10 years. The Cr pool comprised of 52.63-85.47\% SOC. At the very
   beginning, SOC decomposes relatively quickly, however, the speed of SOC
   decomposition begins to slow down at late stage. Furthermore, our study
   also indicate that of the four types of land use, the SOC of the shrub
   and the cultivated land is stable and the cultivated land has the
   potential to be a large carbon sink.},

Abstract = {As we step further into the 21st century, the demand for sustainable
   energy-efficient technology grows higher. The important area of electric
   lighting, currently dominated by decades-old incandescent and
   fluorescent sources, is being taken over by white light emitting diodes,
   which are solid state devices with much greater energy savings.
   Replacement of current inefficient lighting by these LEDs will result in
   reduction of global carbon dioxide emissions, a major cause of global
   warming, among other things. WLEDs hold the potential, in the field of
   photonics, to be as transformational as the transistor was in
   electronics. This core device has the potential to revolutionize how we
   use light, including not only for illumination, but also for
   communications, sensing, navigation, imaging, and many more
   applications. In this tutorial we highlight some of the potentials.},

Abstract = {In recent years, distributed generations based on natural energy or
   co-generation systems are increasing due to global warming and reduction
   of fossil fuels. Many of the distributed generations are set up in the
   vicinity of customers, with the advantage that this decreases
   transmission losses and transmission capacity. However, output power
   generated from renewable energy such as wind power and photovoltaics, is
   influenced by weather conditions. Therefore if the distributed
   generation increases with conventional control schemes, the voltage
   variation in a distribution system becomes a serious problem.
   In this paper, an optimal control method of distribution voltage with
   coordination of distributed installations, such as On Load Tap Changer
   (OLTC), Step Voltage Regulator (SVR), Shunt Capacitor (SC), Shunt
   Reactor (ShR), and Static Var Compensator (SVC), is proposed. In this
   research, the communication infrastructure is assumed to be widespread
   in the distribution network. The proposed technique combines genetic
   algorithm (GA) and Tabu search (TS) to determine the control operation.
   In order to confirm the validity of the proposed method, simulation
   results are presented for a distribution network model with distributed
   (photovoltaic) generation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   warming, skills shortages and the sustainable management of
   infrastructure are all highlighted as matters that every country should
   address. The work of IFME in communicating knowledge, research and best
   practice is illustrated along with a call for greater travel and work
   placements to be made available to young professionals to facilitate
   better communication in the future. The briefing highlights the problem
   of designing infrastructure for a future when global temperatures are
   likely to be far higher; methods of recruiting school students into
   working in the public sector to overcome the demographic problem of the
   looming retirement of the current generation of ageing professionals;
   the scale of the backlog of infrastructure renewal, much of which is now
   near the end of its service life. The briefing concludes with a
   discussion about the current membership of IFME, plans to expand its
   size and remit and an invitation to attend the 2012 congress in Finland.},

Abstract = {P>This paper asks whether innovation has slowed in recent decades. While
   there has been dramatic progress in information and communications
   technology, the recent record of innovation in the crucially important
   agriculture, energy, transportation, and health care sectors is cause
   for concern. The paper also considers whether the pace of innovation is
   sufficient to improve or even maintain living standards in the face of
   still rapidly growing population, global warming, and other challenges.
   I review the major market failures that lead to under-provision of
   innovation and question whether current innovation policy, particularly
   patent policy, is effective in promoting innovation.Ce memoire se
   demande si l'innovation a ralenti au cours des dernieres decennies.
   Alors qu'il y a eu progres dramatique dans les technologies de
   l'information et des communications, le dossier des innovations recentes
   dans des secteurs aussi importants que l'agriculture, l'energie, le
   transport et la sante a de quoi nous donner du souci. Le texte se
   demande aussi quel rythme d'innovation pourrait suffire pour ameliorer
   ou maintenir notre niveau de vie face a une population qui croit
   rapidement, aux changements climatiques, et aux autres defis. On passe
   en revue les principales faillites du marche qui ont pu engendrer une
   offre insuffisante d'innovation, et on se demande si la politique
   d'innovation, en particulier pour ce qui est de la politique des
   brevets, est efficace pour promouvoir l'innovation.},

Abstract = {A theoretical performance study on a traditional vapour-compression
   refrigeration system with refrigerant mixtures based on HFC134a,
   HFC152a, HFC32, HC290, HC1270, HC600, and HC600a was done for various
   ratios and their results are compared with CFC12, CFC22, and HFC134a as
   possible alternative replacements: In spite of the HC refrigerants'
   highly flammable characteristics, they are used in many applications,
   with attention being paid to the safety of the leakage from the system,
   as other refrigerants in recent years are not related with any effect on
   the depletion of the ozone layer and increase in global warming.
   Theoretical results showed that all of the alternative refrigerants
   investigated in the analysis have a slightly lower performance
   coefficient (COP) than CFC12, CFC22, and HFC134a for the condensation
   temperature of 50 degrees C and evaporating temperatures ranging between
   -30 degrees C and 10 degrees C. Refrigerant blends of HC290/HC600a
   (40/60 by wt.\%) instead of CFC12 and HC290/HC1270 (20/80 by wt.\%)
   instead of CFC22 are found to be replacement refrigerants among other
   alternatives in this paper as a result of the analysis. The effects of
   the main parameters of performance analysis such as refrigerant type,
   degree of subcooling, and superheating on the refrigerating effect,
   coefficient of performance and volumetric refrigeration capacity are
   also investigated for various evaporating temperatures. (C) 2010

Abstract = {Recent annual CO2 emission from Japan sums up to 1.2 billion ton, and
   about 17 percent of it is from automobile traffic. There are many
   approaches to reduce CO2 emission and to prevent the global warming, and
   one of the important approaches is the Intelligent Transport Systems.
   This article surveys the effects of the ITS on the energy saving and
   global warming prevention based on the data in Japan, focusing on the
   applications of vehicular communication technologies. The ITS could
   contribute to the energy saving on two aspects: one is to eliminate the
   congestion, which enables each automobile to drive at the fuel optimal
   speeds, and the other is to provide means for modal shift, which reduces
   the traffic. This article surveys the ITS technologies for energy saving
   and CO2 emission reduction, which include traffic signal control, ETC,
   route guidance, cruise control, and automated driving. The
   road-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-vehicle communications play an essential
   role in energy saving as well as in the safety of automobiles and road
   transportation.},

Title = {Long-term in situ monitoring at Dashgil mud volcano, Azerbaijan: a link
   between seismicity, pore-pressure transients and methane emission},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {99},
Number = {1, SI},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Mud volcanism is a global phenomenon usually associated with
   compressional tectonics that favour extrusion of fluid-and clay
   mineral-rich sediment both on land and offshore. Methane, the dominant
   gas phase, is emitted at variable rates during and after emplacement of
   the mud domes. In case of continental mud volcanoes, the gas is directly
   released into the atmosphere, thereby contributing to global warming.
   Azerbaijan is one of the countries with one of the highest abundances of
   mud domes globally. One of the most prominent mud volcanoes, Dashgil,
   has been chosen for a case study because of its historic record of
   violent eruptions, continued activity, and well-documented regional
   geology in the Caucasus orogenic wedge adjacent to the Caspian Sea.
   Since 2003, gas flux has quantitatively measured at one of the two
   crater lakes and is characterized by valve-type behaviour and
   episodically violent degassing. In 2007, the large crater lake was
   additionally equipped with methane fluxmeters as well as an in situ
   pore-pressure probe into the conduit. Our data are complemented by
   regional seismicity, and exhibit the following results: (1) there seems
   to be a significant correlation between changes in pore pressure in the
   conduit feeding the main crater lake and the rate of gas escape; (2)
   changes in gas-flux rate appear to be independent of local seismicity,
   in particular since no larger EQs have been recorded since 2003; (3)
   despite discontinuous monitoring owing to technical failures, we observe
   an overall increase in methane emission with time; (4) nearby earthquake
   activity (<M4.6) can be correlated with pore-pressure transients
   recorded by the piezometer, which reach up to 2.4 kPa compared to the
   pre-seismic value; (5) from time to time, there are strong lake-level
   fluctuations decoupled from precipitation or evaporation, which are
   explained by sub-bottom hydraulic communication between the two crater
   lakes and adjacent gryphons. The wealth of observations leads us to
   conclude that monitoring gas flux and pore pressure provides important
   time series data for both methane emission into the atmosphere and pore
   pressure as a proxy for co-seismic strain.},

Abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that basic exposure measures, such as
   recognition-based items, might not operate identically among older and
   younger adults. We present two studies relevant to this debate. Study 1
   provides experimental confirmation of the recognition decline
   hypothesis, finding an interaction between age and exposure in
   predicting recognition memory for an advertisement related to global
   warming. Study 2 assesses television news project evaluation data to
   explore whether verbatim detail recognition difficulty explains Study 1
   results. The two studies provide complementary evidence, not only
   illustrating recognition decline among the elderly but also providing
   careful control of exposure in Study 1 and the use of multiple messages,
   realistic viewing scenarios, and free recall data in Study 2. Taken
   together, the studies offer a cautionary tale for campaign evaluators.
   On a broader theoretical level, the results suggest a fruitful path for
   communication research focused on the nuanced and potentially critical
   moderating role of age.},

Abstract = {Most American congregations belong to denominations. These national
   networks often promote relevant political issues that constituent
   congregations may choose to address. Therefore, religious organizations
   might play a significant role in promoting the process of policy
   diffusion in the U.S. states. At the same time, congregations are
   tradition-maintaining institutions that focus first on their own
   immediate concerns, promoting the maintenance of distinctive regional
   political contexts and reinforcing the variation of federalism. In this
   article, we assess the role that religious organizations play in
   American federal democracy, promoting diffusion or the status quo, with
   respect to one crucial issue on which religious groups have been
   particularly vocal: the environment and global warming. We employ two
   datasets (a large-N national survey and two in-depth survey case studies
   of clergy in Ohio and South Carolina) and find evidence that religious
   organizations are vast communication networks that can promote policy
   diffusion, but typically do not.},

Title = {Environmental impact of mining activities on the surface water quality
   in Tibet: Gyama valley},

Abstract = {Nearly 20 years of industrial scale metal mining operations in Tibet
   have caused an impact on the region's surface water quality. However, no
   information with respect to the pollution has been provided to the
   public. The aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical quality of the
   stream water and to assess the present and future potential risks of
   acid mine drainage to the regional and downstream environments.
   This study, based on data collected in 2006, 2007 and 2008 in the Gyama
   valley, using the Environmental Risk Index (I-ER) documents that
   elevated concentrations of Cu, Pb, Zn, Mn, Fe and Al in the surface
   water and streambed at the upper/middle part of the valley pose a
   considerably high risk to the local environment. In contrast, the risk
   level at the stream source area is zero and only minor risk at the lower
   reaches. The iron and copper contamination of the upper/middle part of
   the river appears to be both natural and accelerated by the mining
   activities. The level of dissolved contaminants in the water decreases
   within short distance downstream due to precipitation and sorption to
   the streambed and strong dilution by a tributary stream and eventually
   by the Lhasa River.
   A high content of heavy metals in the stream sediments as well as in a
   number of tailings with gangue and material from the ore processing,
   poses a great potential threat to the downstream water users.
   Environmental changes such as global warming or increased mining
   activity may increase the mobility of these pools of heavy metals. (c)

Abstract = {Since May 24, 2006 millions of people have seen the movie ``An
   Inconvenient Truth.{''} Several countries have even proposed using the
   film as an educational tool in school classrooms. However, it is not yet
   clear that the movie accomplishes its apparent goals of increasing
   knowledge and concern, and motivating people to reduce their greenhouse
   gas emissions. Two studies are reported, one with a sample of community
   moviegoers, and one with a sample of students. Across the two studies,
   results show that watching ``An Inconvenient Truth{''} does increase
   knowledge about the causes of global warming, concern for the
   environment, and willingness to reduce greenhouse gases. However, the
   results of Study 2 suggest that willingness to take action immediately
   following movie viewing does not necessarily translate into action 1
   month later. Recommendations are made for how the movie could be used to
   create behavioral change.},

   activities of the locality emit the heat in atmosphere. The present data
   of winter studies indicates the fluctuation of atmospheric temperature
   in the various places in the city, although considerable variations in
   the atmospheric temperature in market area due to heat activities in
   hotels and restaurants. The average deflection in ambient temperature is
   recorded by 2 degrees C. In the age of modernization and urbanization of
   localities, the use of certain appliances and their collective emission
   of heat in the air increase the air temperature, while the mass domestic
   activities of localities contribute to increase in environmental
   temperature and ultimately global warming. The tools and methods used in
   present study may provide new strategies in the thermal atmospheric
   study. The study may reflect the light on possible causes and sources
   responsible to contribute the atmospheric warming.},

Abstract = {A number of governments and organizations around the world agree that
   the first step to address national and international problems such as
   energy independence, global warming or emergency resilience, is the
   redesign of electricity networks, known as Smart Grids. Typically, power
   grids have ``broadcasted{''} power from generation plants to large
   population of consumers on a suboptimal way. Nevertheless, the fusion of
   energy delivery networks and digital information networks, along with
   the introduction of intelligent monitoring systems (Smart Meters) and
   renewable energies, would enable two-way electricity trading
   relationships between electricity suppliers and electricity consumers.
   The availability of real-time information on electricity demand and
   pricing, would enable suppliers optimizing their delivery systems, while
   consumers would have the means to minimize their bill by turning on
   appliances at off-peak hours. The construction of the Smart Grid entails
   the design and deployment of information networks and systems of
   unprecedented requirements on storage, real-time event processing and
   availability. In this paper, a series of system architectures to store
   and process Smart Meter reading data are explored and compared aiming to
   establish a solid foundation in which future intelligent systems could
   be supported.},

Abstract = {Does passive housing really have better environmental performance than
   conventional housing? Three passive houses and four conventional houses
   were compared using a life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. The
   comparison also provided an actor analysis for the building supply chain
   and building inhabitants. Results are presented for two scenarios:
   `conventional choices' and `green choices' by the actors. The comparison
   confirms that passive houses have lower energy use than conventional
   houses, but when the environmental impact of energy production is taken
   into consideration, the outcome is less clear. Conventional houses can
   be equally good environmentally in terms of global warming,
   acidification, or radioactive waste as typical passive houses with
   electrical heating depending on the actors' choices. Actor analysis
   shows that inhabitants' and material producers' electricity choice are
   very important, while other choices (e.g. green transport) are less
   important. The findings highlight the importance of environmentally
   responsible decisions throughout the whole life cycle and the need for
   appropriate behaviours and actions, along with implications for improved
   communication.},

Abstract = {Global warming, rising energy prices and increasing awareness of
   ``green{''} customers have brought energy efficient manufacturing on top
   of the agenda of governments as well as of industrial companies. The
   industrial sector still accounts for about 33\% of the final energy
   consumption. This paper will contribute to a more energy efficient
   manufacturing by demonstrating how energy efficiency can be integrated
   into different levels of decision-making in companies. The paper will
   present methods for measuring and evaluating energy efficiency
   improvements in manufacturing processes. Different Key Performance
   Indicators (KPI) will be considered and economic evaluation methods will
   be outlined. Moreover, an example of the integration of energy
   efficiency aspects into the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) will show how
   energy efficiency improvements in the manufacturing process can be
   facilitated by influencing the tactical and operational level of
   decision making.},

Title = {Environmental Policy and Technical Change: A Survey},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {163-219},
Abstract = {In this survey we review the literature that studies the relationship
   between environmental policy and technical change. We divide the
   literature in two broad areas of research. First, we look at the studies
   that evaluate the impact of environmental regulation on technological
   change after the implementation of environmental policy (ex-post).
   Second, we introduce the studies that assess the impact of environmental
   regulation on innovation dynamics before the implementation of
   environmental policy (ex-ante). While the first group is dominated by
   econometric work, in the second group we find the fast growing
   literature based on Integrated Assessment Models (IAMB) created to study
   the policies to limit global warming. Both ex-post and ex-ante studies
   corroborate the hypothesis that environmental policy plays an important
   role in inducing innovation and in increasing the adoption as well as
   the diffusion of new technologies. Policy experiments carried out using
   Integrated Assessment Models highlight that the size and the direction
   of the inducement effect depend on at least three elements. First,
   relative prices play an important role, but also scale and market size
   effects are relevant in shaping incentives to innovate. Second, the
   inducement effect can vary across different R\&D programs and with the
   degree of policy stringency. Third, nearly all studies stress the role
   of substitution in terms of flexibility, either within the energy
   sector, between energy and other inputs such as labour or capital, or
   between final sectors with different energy intensities. A relevant
   lesson that should be communicated to policy makers is the importance of
   combining efficiently policies to address the environmental and the
   knowledge externalities. Areas in which there is room for more research
   are mentioned throughout the survey. They include the need of exploiting
   better cross-country dimension of recent panel data sets, launching a
   new comprehensive assessment of the determinants of eco-friendly
   innovation in developing countries, assessing the interactions between
   ``clean{''} and ``dirty{''} R\&D, testing whether firms are operating at
   the frontier of efficiency or not.},

Abstract = {This position paper illustrates the use of a natural framework for the
   modelling, analysis, and design of engineering systems that involve two
   or more controllers, each of which has an associated objective function.
   Such systems arise when ordinary single controller systems are networked
   through communication links so that the information available to each
   controller may contain aspects of the other systems' states and the
   optimization of each objective function is no longer decoupled from each
   other. Single controller optimization is no longer directly applicable.
   Appropriate to the study of such systems is the theory of games that has
   been developing in mathematics, economics, and engineering for the past
   60 years. There are extensive applications in economics, but in
   engineering the applications are scarce. In recent years, there has been
   great attention to global problems such as the negative environmental
   impact of energy use, and global warming. These problems arise from
   complex systems with multiple controllers. Among the approaches for
   dealing with the problems, there should be one on a total systems
   approach with a game theory base. A natural framework for this is the
   subject of this policy paper.},

Title = {Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the
   active substance sulfuryl fluoride European Food Safety Authority},
Journal = {EFSA JOURNAL},

Abstract = {Sulfuryl fluoride is a new active substance for which, in accordance
   with Article 6(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC3, the United Kingdom
   received an application from Dow AgroSciences for inclusion in Annex I
   to Directive 91/414/EEC. Complying with Article 6 of Directive
   91/414/EEC, the completeness of the dossier was evaluated and confirmed
   by Commission Decision 2003/305/EC4.
   Following the agreement between the Commission of the European
   Communities (hereafter referred to as ` the Commission') and the EFSA
   for the EFSA to organise a peer review of those new active substances
   for which the decision on the completeness of the dossier had been
   published after June 2002, the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS),
   the United Kingdom, made the report of its initial evaluation of the
   dossier on sulfuryl fluoride, hereafter referred to as the Draft
   Assessment Report (DAR), available on 29 October 2004.
   The peer review was initiated on 9 November 2004 by dispatching the DAR
   for consultation of the Member States and the applicant. Subsequently,
   the comments received on the DAR were examined by the RMS and the need
   for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 28 September
   2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the
   applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings
   with Member State experts in September 2006.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took
   place with representatives from the Member States on 27 September 2007,
   leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the
   representative uses as an insecticide, comprising application as a
   fumigant in food storage to control all life stages of arthropods (e.g.
   meal moth, flour and grain beetles) in emptied flour mills and empty
   grain storage facilities at maximum concentrations of 128 g/m(3) (CTP =
   1500 (Concentration X Time Product)). Details of the applications and
   timings can be found in the list of end points. The uses submitted in
   the DAR on dried fruit and tree nut commodities were withdrawn by the
   applicant for the EU evaluation.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was `ProFume',
   a gas (GA), registered under different trade names in Europe. The
   formulation contains 99.4\% w/w sulfuryl fluoride pure (the technical
   active substance is the product).
   Analytical methodology is available for the determination of the active
   substance and the impurities in the technical material as manufactured
   and for the active substance in the formulation, which is in practice
   the technical material.
   Several methods are available to monitor the compounds given in the
   respective residue definitions for food of plant origin, in blood and
   urine, however additional data may be required after the finalization of
   the residue definitions in the different matrices. A data gap was
   identified for a method for residues in air.
   With regard to mammalian toxicity, sulfuryl fluoride has been classified
   (29th ATP, Commission Directive 2005/73/EC5) as T; R23 `Toxic by
   inhalation' based on reported deaths in humans. In addition, the
   experts' meeting proposed classification as T; R25 `Toxic if `wallowed'
   and Xi; R37 `Irritating to the respiratory system'. It was also
   classified as Harmful; R48/20 `Danger of serious damage to health by
   prolonged exposure/ inhalation route'. The relevant short-term exposure
   No Observed Adverse Effect Levels (NOAELs) are 30 ppm in mice and
   rabbits, 20 ppm in dogs and 100 ppm in rats based on slight renal
   hyperplasia and mineralisation at 300 ppm. In rats and mice the longterm
   NOAEL is 20 ppm. Sulfuryl fluoride does not show any genotoxic or
   carcinogenic potential. It is not a reproductive or developmental
   toxicant. In multigeneration studies the parental NOAEL was 5 ppm while
   the NOAEL in offspring was 20 ppm based on reduced growth during
   lactation at 150 ppm. The lowest relevant developmental NOAEL is 75 ppm,
   from the rabbit study. The NOAEL for the acute study in rats is 300 ppm.
   The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.014 mg/kg bw/day, based on the
   long term toxicity study in rats, with a safety factor of 100. The Acute
   Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.7 mg/kg bw and the Acceptable Operator
   Exposure Concentration (AOEC) resulted in 1 ppm. For the bystander
   exposure assessment, an AOEC of 3 ppm was set. The RMS proposed that
   operators introducing fumigant or carrying out tasks associated with the
   aeration procedure should wear suitable respiratory protective
   equipment. Based on the available data, a 10 metre exclusion zone around
   the fumigated structure was considered to protect unprotected persons
   (i.e. bystanders) from levels of sulfuryl fluoride above 3 ppm.
   Metabolism studies that address the nature of the residues on food
   commodities upon fumigation with sulfuryl fluoride were not submitted.
   Therefore it was discussed by experts whether the metabolism or mode of
   degradation, respectively, of sulfuryl fluoride in food and feed
   commodities was sufficiently addressed and whether there was
   satisfactory proof from the information and papers submitted, that the
   proposed breakdown mechanism is identical in all matrices as suggested
   by the applicant. The experts concluded that the available information
   is not sufficient to assess the involved reactions, to verify the
   reported results and to confirm that sulfuryl fluoride and free fluoride
   ion will be the only relevant residues the consumer may be exposed to.
   Therefore the consumer risk assessment, mainly with regard to the nature
   of the residue, cannot be finalised.
   Even though uses on the fumigation of food items (dried fruits, nuts)
   were withdrawn during the peer review procedure and only uses for
   structural treatments remain, there is still the potential for consumer
   exposure to inorganic fluoride through contaminated products, such as
   flour and bran that remained in the mill machinery during fumigation, or
   grain stored in silos in the mill. Available data show that high
   fluoride residue levels in flour and bran occurred after the production
   in a treated mill structure had been taken up again. Therefore measures
   to avoid contaminated cereal products getting into the food chain are
   necessary if, in practice, contamination cannot be avoided.
   The RMS suggested separate MRLs for fluoride ion should be proposed
   based on background levels. However, there are currently no agreed
   acceptable fluoride background levels in food products in the EU and
   therefore the allocation of an adequate MRL for fluoride might be
   difficult. Any higher MRL than at natural background levels would
   trigger a consumer exposure and risk assessment. It is noted that such
   assessment will also need to consider other sources of fluoride
   exposure.
   Sulfuryl fluoride is a gas under all environmental conditions (boiling
   point -54 degrees C). The vapour pressure is deemed to be high according
   to the available data. Potential degradation routes for sulfuryl
   fluoride were analysed in the DAR. All routes were considered negligible
   except the chemical hydrolysis that may occur in ocean waters.
   The initial assessment of the fate and behaviour of sulfuryl fluoride in
   the environment was based on a limited set of experimental data
   (essentially limited to the physical and chemical properties of the
   substance) and a number of assumptions and indirect information (such as
   production figures and atmospheric half-life) that were used as input
   parameters in the fugacity models employed for the assessment of the
   fate and behaviour of the substance at global scale. Assessment of the
   fate and behaviour of sulfuryl fluoride at the field scale level was not
   presented by the applicant in the initial submission. Also the fate and
   behaviour of hydrolysis transformation products was not addressed. A
   number of data gaps were identified in the early stages of the peer
   review to properly document the information used in the assessment.
   One of the key parameters used in the assessment is the atmospheric
   lifetime. The value used by the applicant was derived from a presumed
   monitored tropospheric concentration only available by a personal
   communication of one of the scientists involved. The experts' meeting
   considered that the data provided were not sufficiently documented for
   regulatory purposes and identified a data gap for the determination of
   atmospheric lifetime.
   At the experts' meetings (PRAPeR 02 and 03) on environmental fate and
   behaviour and ecotoxicology, respectively, the RMS was asked to
   undertake further assessments: in particular on wet deposition and the
   potential for contamination of soil and water by metabolites of sulfuryl
   fluoride; to evaluate field-scale PEC values in soil and surface water
   close to treated installations and revised fugacity modelling to
   calculate global-scale PECs in soil, water and air. Additional estimates
   were also requested for global warming potential (GWP), based on worst
   case atmospheric lifetime and anticipated sales volumes. These points
   have been largely addressed by the RMS in addendum 3 of May 2007 based
   on the information provided by the applicant. However, the assessment
   provided by the applicant and presented by the RMS in the addendum did
   not strictly follow the scenario approach proposed by the experts'
   meeting ( only lifetime of 4.5 yr was used and production figures were
   generally limited to historical records from 1992-2000) and did not take
   into consideration most recent information available at the time on the
   occurrence of sulfuryl fluoride in the atmosphere. This information is
   crucial since it supersedes the information used by the applicant to
   estimate the atmospheric lifetime of the substance on which most of the
   fate and behaviour assessment of sulfiryl fluoride is based. As a
   consequence, EFSA had redone parts of the modelling presented by the
   applicant and the RMS in addendum 3 of May 2007. The most relevant
   results are presented in the EFSA conclusion, and the background input
   parameters and calculations are documented in the EFSA addendum of July
   2007.
   With respect to the field scale assessment, EFSA did a preliminary
   sensitivity analysis of the assumptions used in the field scale soil
   assessment (based on LEVEL I fugacity model) and added some
   considerations to address the transformation products of sulfuryl
   fluoride at field scale. Neither the RMS addendum 3 nor the EFSA
   addendum has been peer reviewed.
   A number of data gaps were identified during the peer review. The main
   areas of concern from the fate and behaviour point of view are the high
   uncertainty associated with the atmospheric lifetime (best available
   estimate was about 15 yr) and the intrinsic global warming potential
   that needed to be re-calculated. At the time of finalising this
   conclusion values previously estimated based on measurements of the
   AGAGE (Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment) network have been
   refined and a longer atmospheric lifetime than previously reported is
   recently quoted in the scientific literature (36 +/- 11 yr). Based on
   these recent data, a GWP of 4780 for the 100 years horizon has been
   published.
   Sulfuryl fluoride is very toxic to aquatic organisms. However, due to
   the specific use and the physicalchemical properties of the substance,
   exposure of non-target organisms is considered negligible and hence the
   risk to non-target organisms is considered to be low.},

Abstract = {Since global warming has seriously endangered the living environment of
   human being and their health and safety, the development of low-carbon
   economy has become an irreversible global trend. Under the background of
   economic globalization, low-carbon economy will surely exert a
   significant impact on global trade pattern. Countries are paying more
   and more attention to the green trade. The emission permits trade of
   carbon between the developed countries and the developing countries has
   become more mature than ever. The carbon tariff caused by the
   distribution of the ``big cake{''} will make the low-cost advantage in
   developing countries cease to exist, which will, in turn, affect the
   foreign trade, economic development, employment and people's living in
   developing countries. Therefore, under the background of this trend, we
   should perfect the relevant laws and regulations on trade and
   environment as soon as possible, optimize trade structure, promote
   greatly the development of service trade, transform thoroughly the mode
   of development in foreign trade, take advantage of the international
   carbon trading market by increasing the added value of export products
   resulted from technological innovation to achieve mutual benefit and
   win-win results and promote common development.},

Abstract = {The rapidly increasing contribution towards global warming from the
   information communication technology (ICT) sector is a clear indication
   of the need for energy efficient green communication networks. For
   instance, in the case of cellular networks, over 80\% of the total
   energy is consumed at the access network. On the other hand,
   incorporating self-sustainability and autonomy in its operation,
   control, and maintenance is significantly vital due to relatively larger
   sizes, higher complexities, and dynamic behaviors of future networks
   than those of current networks. In this paper, with the inspiration from
   the ecological principle of protocooperation, a novel energy efficient
   cellular access network architecture is proposed. With the adoption of
   the wake-up technology, base transceiver stations (BTSs) are made to
   protocooperate with each other to achieve higher energy efficiency
   within a cellular access network. Protocooperation is one of the
   ecological interactions by which two interacting species gain benefit
   through cooperation. However, this type of cooperation is not compulsory
   for the survival of any of these two species. To accomplish less energy
   consumption and higher self-sustainability at the access network, BTSs
   cooperatively and dynamically switch between active and sleep modes
   depending on the current traffic situation. The extent of
   self-sustainability incorporated in the proposed architecture is studied
   and analyzed. As per the result, our proposed architecture and algorithm
   are capable of achieving a significant amount of energy saving, which is
   an important step towards a self-sustainable green communication system.},

Abstract = {Global warming necessitates a variety of responses including efficient
   energy use to reduce carbon emissions. The associated cost reduction
   should affect economic growth in general. For electricity, smart grid is
   an upcoming technology being applied currently in developed countries.
   Australia, Canada, China and the United States are planning to finish
   the smart grid in 2010-2012, while the European Union has been applying
   it since 2005. We believe Thailand should start considering this
   technology immediately. This paper deploy technology roadmapping
   approach to identify the research and development needed to support the
   smart grid in Thailand. We will define the smart grid and discuss its
   current status in Thailand. Its establishment will require the
   employment of a collection of technologies, including information,
   operational, communication, energy and consumer technologies. Ongoing
   projects and ready-to-use technologies will be reviewed, the policies
   and plans related to electricity delivery infrastructure will be
   analyzed, and Thailand's readiness for smart grid will be assessed. The
   main focus will be on identifying the existing problems that need
   further research and development. By analyzing capabilities of
   Thailand's research and by surveying the market, some predictions for
   next essential developments can be made. This paper will be useful for
   research organizations.},

Abstract = {To deal with environmental problems such as global warming and depletion
   of energy resources, energy conservation measures in the civilian sector
   and the spread of renewable energy are required strongly. As a
   next-generation energy system to achieve them, Cluster Energy Management
   System (CEMS) is beginning to be studied in Japan. CEMS is the energy
   management system, which cooperates with various dispersed power sources
   and buildings using information technology. CEMS monitors and adjusts
   energy supply and demand in real-time to form the best combination of
   them, and achieves high efficiency energy usage. In this study, the
   electricity energy measurement system using KNIVES (Keio University
   Network oriented Intelligent and Versatile Energy saving System) was
   build in Keio University Shonan Fujisawa Campus (SFC). In addition, it
   is declared that this system can predict electric power demand based on
   the past data obtained from itself.},

Title = {Are Some Pneumatic Conveying Problems Wicked?},
Journal = {PARTICULATE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {360-368},
Abstract = {Wicked problems are some of the most challenging in the world. World
   health, global warming, and the energy challenge are some that quickly
   come to mind. Wicked problems are problems that do not have right and
   wrong solutions but rather have degrees of good and bad. These problems
   can be tamed but never totally conquered. Some may say that dilute
   pneumatic phase conveying is totally solved but some would indicate that
   there is a subset that is still a big challenge. Dense phase conveying
   issues are more wicked than dilute phase conveying issues. One can
   probably take a closer look at such parameters as size, distribution,
   shape, abrasiveness, hardness, environmental condition, densities,
   tackiness, and others and define what properties or conditions cause the
   conveying problem to turn wicked. Industry is always developing new
   materials and processes that often lessen our confidence in being able
   to design conveying systems without problems. More stringent conditions
   are placed on the system whether it is the change in the character of
   the material to the size of the system, large or minute. This work will
   address the general field of pneumatic conveying and explore the
   character of wickedness and suggest some strategies to tame wicked
   problems. Previously solved problems will be explored as methods of
   taming the issues. There are some suggested strategies to tame wicked
   problems. Most of these involve getting expert teams or groups together
   and to begin to communicate and discuss and brainstorm.},

Abstract = {The rapid development of new cities in developing countries (such like
   India, China, and Vietnam) has recently increased the growth of
   motorcycle business in global market. In the past, lack of adequate
   systems to control the quantity of overloaded polluted product within
   the motorcycle industry has led to serious problems of global warming.
   In order to reduce the damage of environment, this research presents a
   process-based reference model and information system for helping the
   motorcycle Industry to better manage and control the quantity and
   quality of supply network. The tool set of IDEF (Integration Definition)
   is applied to describe the overall workflow of operation processes. An
   Object-Oriented analysis approach is used to represent the architecture
   of the collaborative model. A prototype web-based platform is
   constructed to demonstrate the model for controlling the supply network
   in overall materials and show the improved communication channel.},

Abstract = {Coastal erosion is an issue of widespread concern. As one of the most
   important economic regions in China, the coast of the Yangtze Delta has
   been showing a trend towards erosion with global warming and the
   increasing human activities in the catchment and its estuary. Currently,
   most published studies about coastal erosion in the area focused on the
   causes and types of erosion. This paper presents a Decision Support
   Framework (DSF) for the risk assessment of coastal erosion in
   consideration of the potential management problems and challenges for
   economic development in the coastal zone of the Yangtze Delta. The
   framework consists of four major components: integrated database,
   GIS-based risk assessment models, scenarios generator and visualization
   toolkit. Especially, we developed a GIS-based risk assessment model for
   the muddy coasts of Yangtze Delta. An Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)
   method, which is instrumental in combining computer intelligence and
   experts' knowledge, was used to weight the variables of the model. The
   assessment results show the validity of the approach. Accordingly, the
   DSF will make the specialized data and information more accessible to
   managers, and has an extensive capability to facilitate communication
   and synergetic work between humans and computers. In this way, it is
   expected to make manager make more scientific decision.},

Abstract = {Depletion of fossil oil deposits and the escalating threat of global
   warming have put clean energy research, which includes the search for
   clean energy carriers such as hydrogen and methane as well as the
   reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, on the urgent agenda. A
   significant technical challenge has been recognized as the development
   of a viable method to efficiently trap hydrogen, methane and carbon
   dioxide gas molecules in a confined space for various applications. This
   issue can be addressed by employing highly porous materials as storage
   media, and porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) which have
   exceptionally high surface areas as well as chemically-tunable
   structures are playing an unusual role in this respect. In this feature
   article we provide an overview of the current status of clean energy
   applications of porous MOFs, including hydrogen storage, methane storage
   and carbon dioxide capture.},

Abstract = {What determines a nation's sovereignty over a particular territory? This
   question is now the subject of a heated debate on the international
   political scene, with global warming having rendered previously
   unreachable Arctic resources accessible to the five countries that have
   territorial claims in the far North: Canada, the United States, Russia,
   Denmark, and Norway. By building on the concepts of human and material
   agency, I demonstrate how both human and material agents represent the
   collective of Canada and thus give the Canadian government a material
   presence in the Arctic. This presence is key to actors such as the
   Canadian prime minister who are making the case for Canadian sovereignty
   in the Arctic region. This article therefore shows that the agency of
   participants in deliberation over socioscientific issues is largely
   influenced by the action of both other humans and material entities.},

Title = {Supporting distributed team working in 3D virtual worlds: a case study
   in Second Life},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE TECHNOLOGY AND SMART EDUCATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Pages = {200+},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to report on a study into how a
   three-dimensional (3D) virtual world (Second Life) can facilitate
   socialisation and team working among students working on a team project
   at a distance. This models the situation in many commercial sectors
   where work is increasingly being conducted across time zones and between
   multiple teams. Collaboration in these geographically distributed teams
   is virtual rather than through face-to-face interactions. The paper
   investigates how a virtual world such as Second Life compares to other
   collaboration tools such as instant messaging or Skype; and the
   challenges that students experience in becoming acquainted with and
   working in Second Life.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper has employed a qualitative
   research methodology involving data collection through group interviews,
   epistolary (email) interviews and semi-structured individual interviews.
   The data have been analysed by applying the inductive analysis
   technique.
   Findings - The analysis is presented through answers to questions which
   educators may have about the effectiveness of virtual worlds in
   supporting collaboration in virtual teams.
   Research limitations/implications - The paper highlights the pedagogical
   role of 3D virtual worlds in supporting communication, team working and
   community building. The methodology will be of interest to researchers
   in the area of virtual worlds as there is little guidance in the
   literature about how to evaluate student experiences of these
   environments.
   Practical implications - The research reported in this paper is timely
   and significant in view of current business scenarios such as the
   challenges of a globally distributed work-place, the need to offer
   training to develop employees' skills of working in distributed
   environments and to meet changing market needs. Furthermore, the
   research will support the development of a coordinated response to the
   Leitch review of skills in the UK, which identified issues of
   resource-intensive travel, global warming and the need for businesses to
   be seen as ``green'' for customer attraction and retention.
   Originality/value - The paper discusses the role of 3D virtual worlds in
   supporting student team projects involving students who are
   geographically dispersed. The sense of visual presence and of place in a
   3D world can make socialising in a virtual world, a more ``human''
   experience than in 2D environments such as web sites, e-mail, wikis and
   blogs, and even phone or video-conferencing. The research reported in
   this paper could enhance uptake of 3D virtual worlds by organisations
   facing the challenges of facilitating socialisation and knowledge
   sharing in a distributed workforce.},

Abstract = {A three-dimensional real time proximity warning system (PWS) has been
   developed using a combination of object oriented programming techniques,
   open graphics library (OpenGL),global positioning system (GPS) and
   wireless communications networking. The main purpose of this research is
   to probe the application of information technologies in preventing the
   run-over incidents that occur frequently in large mobile equipment
   operations in open pit mining. The system provides three major
   functions: first, the system has the ability to display
   three-dimensional drawing exchange format (DXF) maps and has the basic
   map operation functions such as zoom in, zoom out, move, rotate, etc.
   Second, the system can show the real time positions of the trucks on the
   laptop installed on the truck and generate warming information when the
   clients are too close to each other, and then send the warming
   information to the client trucks. Third, the system has the ability to
   record the GPS positions and regenerate the surface of the mine based on
   the new recorded positions. So the surface maps of the mine can be
   updated timely. The whole system can be divided into two parts: server
   and clients. The clients can be any moving utilities with a GPS device
   installed. The server is responsible for the communication between the
   clients, monitors the behaviour of the clients and computes the distance
   between the clients in real time. Whenever the distance between two
   clients is less than the safe distance, warning messages will be sent to
   the clients and shown on the computer screens installed on the clients.
   The hardware of the system contains the wireless network, GPS receivers
   and computers installed on trucks. The system can also be applied to
   other industrial applications to monitor the activities of moving
   utilities and improve operational safety. This paper will explain the
   development of the system and display the field test results.},

Abstract = {Recent years have seen extensive research in home energy management
   systems to address the issues of rising energy prices and global
   warming. The focus of these research efforts is to create a smart
   environment which integrates household energy consumption appliances and
   devices into a home area network. This home area network collects energy
   consumption data constantly in real time in order support data analysis,
   decision making and enable the householders to have a transparent view
   of their energy consumption. The ultimate goal is to use Information and
   Communication Technologies (ICT) to help householders to reduce their
   energy consumption while maintaining level of their comfort. The
   proposed recommender system is a subsystem of an integrated energy
   management system which involves innovative technologies to monitor and
   analyse energy consumption of households in real time and enables them
   to have more detailed picture of their energy consumption and also
   provide them advice on efficient energy usage. The recommender system is
   supported by the monitoring system which consists of a network of energy
   consumption monitoring sensors. These sensors read energy consumption of
   household appliances in real time and send the data to a central server
   for storage, analysis and query purposes. In this paper we present a
   recommender system which provides advice to householders proactively by
   taking in account their energy consumption patterns and also provides
   answers to their queries regarding efficient use of energy.},

Abstract = {Emerging popular literature trumpeting the prospects for Manifest
   Destiny through a greener capitalism illustrates the re-emergence of
   American myth to explain chaotic times and uphold America's exceptional
   character. Today, this character is dominated ideologically by the

   dissects neoliberal rhetorical style as articulated through national
   myth and ecological jeremiad in bestselling author Thomas Friedman's
   (2008) oCode Greeno thesis. In Code Green, an American strategy for
   confronting the convergence of global warming, new economic competition
   abroad, and population growth, the author traces a mythic oevolutiono in
   ecological jeremiad toward a sustainable free market frontier. Crafting
   a muscular yet ostensibly non-political rhetoric of individualist
   sacrifice and reward, Friedman refigures the dark side of Western-led
   globalization's past.},

Abstract = {Molecular mechanisms leading to myocardial injury during warm or cold
   ischemia are insufficiently understood. Although proteasomes are thought
   to contribute to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, their roles
   during the ischemic period remain elusive. Because donor hearts are
   commonly exposed to prolonged global cold ischemia prior to cardiac
   transplantation, we evaluated the role and regulation of the proteasome
   during cold ischemic storage of rat hearts in context of the myocardial
   ATP content. When measured at the actual tissue ATP concentration,
   cardiac proteasome peptidase activity increased by 225\% as ATP declined
   during cold ischemic storage of hearts in University of Wisconsin (UW)
   solution for up to 48 h. Addition of the specific proteasome inhibitor
   epoxomicin to the UW solution inhibited proteasome activity in the
   cardiac extracts, significantly reduced edema formation and preserved
   the ultrastructural integrity of the cardiomyocyte. Utilizing purified
   20S/26S proteasome enzyme preparations, we demonstrate that this
   activation can be attributed to a subset of 26S proteasomes which are
   stable at ATP concentrations far below physiological levels, that ATP
   negatively regulates its activity and that maximal activation occurs at
   ATP concentrations in the low mu mol/L range. These data suggest that
   proteasome activation is a pathophysiologically relevant mechanism of
   cold ischemic myocardial injury. A subset of 26S proteasomes appears to
   be a cell-destructive protease that is activated as ATP levels decline.
   Proteasome inhibition during cold ischemia preserves the ultrastructural
   integrity of the cardiomyocyte. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights,

Title = {Conceptions of Knowledge in Research on Students' Understanding of the
   Greenhouse Effect: Methodological Positions and Their Consequences for
   Representations of Knowing},

Abstract = {Much of the research on students' understanding of the greenhouse effect
   and global warming reports poor results. Students are claimed to hold
   misconceptions and naive beliefs, and the impact of teaching on their
   conceptions is also low. In the present study, these results are called
   into question, and it is argued that they may to a large extent be seen
   as artifacts of the research methods deployed, in particular when
   written questionnaires are used. When following students' project work
   in school over a long period, many of the misunderstandings reported in
   the literature do not appear. It is argued that the appropriation and
   use of scientific language when discussing complex socioscientific
   issues is a gradual process. When observing the language and mediational
   means students use over time, it is obvious that they are able to
   identify and use central distinctions in their interactions. They are
   also able to make productive use of texts and other materials that allow
   them to successively approximate scientific modes of reasoning. Thus,
   what students know emerges in communicative practices where they
   interact with others and with cultural tools in a focused activity. It
   is argued that students' knowledge of complex multidisciplinary
   phenomena of this kind may be particularly ill-suited to conventional
   questionnaire types of testing. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed

Abstract = {Global warming risks from emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) by
   anthropogenic activities have increased the need for the identification
   of ecosystems with high carbon sink capacity as an alternative
   mitigation strategy of terrestrial carbon sequestration. The
   agroforestry sector has received recent attention for its enormous
   potential carbon pools that reduce carbon emissions to the atmosphere.
   The Nubra Valley (Trans-Himalayan region) is covered with more than
   575,000 agroforestry plantations (willow and poplar). These species have
   been found to sequester more than 75,000 tonnes of carbon. Every year
   these plantations are contributing 400 tonnes of leaf litter to the
   ground, which is one of the best sources of soil organic carbon. This
   communication attempts to suggest some appropriate management practices
   to improve soil organic carbon pools by analysing available information
   of agroforestry plants in the Nubra Valley by quantification of biomass
   contribution by willow and poplar species within the valley and CO2
   sequestration rates by the living biomass.},

Abstract = {A combination of beta spiral and minimum length inverse methods, along
   with a compilation of historical and recent high-resolution CTD data,
   are used to produce a quantitative estimate of the subthermocline
   circulation in Cascadia Basin. Flow in the North Pacific Deep Water,
   from 900-1900m, is characterized by a basin-scale anticyclonic gyre.
   Below 2000m, two water masses are present within the basin interior,
   distinguished by different potential temperature-salinity lines. These
   water masses, referred to as Cascadia Basin Bottom Water (CBBW) and
   Cascadia Basin Deep Water (CBDW), are separated by a transition zone at
   about 2400 m depth. Below the depth where it freely communicates with
   the broader North Pacific, Cascadia Basin is renewed by northward flow
   through deep gaps in the Blanco Fracture Zone that feeds the lower limb
   of a vertical circulation cell within the CBBW. Lower CBBW gradually
   warms and returns to the south at lighter density. Isopycnal layer
   renewal times, based on combined lateral and diapycnal advective fluxes,
   increase upwards from the bottom. The densest layer, existing in the
   southeast quadrant of the basin below similar to 2850 m, has an
   advective flushing time of 0.6 years. The total volume flushing time for
   the entire CBBW is 2.4 years, corresponding to an average water parcel
   residence time of 4.7 years. Geothermal heating at the Cascadia Basin
   seafloor produces a characteristic bottom-intensified temperature
   anomaly and plays an important role in the conversion of cold bottom
   water to lighter density within the CBBW. Although covering only about
   0.05\% of the global seafloor, the combined effects of bottom heat flux
   and diapycnal mixing within Cascadia Basin provide about 2-3\% of the
   total required global input to the upward branch of the global
   thermohaline circulation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {GOAL: ZERO ENERGY BUILDING Exemplary Experience Based on the Solar
   Estate Solarsiedlung Freiburg am Schlierberg, Germany},

Abstract = {Zero energy consumption. The goal sounds simple and is presented
   excessively in variations all over the world. Energy and environmental
   politics demand zero consumption as a long-term goal, marketing has
   discovered the concept and first buildings and settlements aiming at
   balanced energy or emission budgets have been constructed.
   As an example, the German Federal Government specifies in its fifth
   energy research programme (2005): For new buildings, the goal is to
   reduce the primary energy demand, i.e. the energy demand for heating,
   domestic hot water, ventilation, air-conditioning, lighting and
   auxiliary energy, again by half compared to the current state of the
   art. The long-term goal is zero-emission buildings. England and the USA
   aim for zero carbon developments and net-zero energy buildings (DOE,
   2009) in political programmes.
   The Vatican accepted the offer of climatic ``indulgence{''}-and thus
   became the first country in the world to completely compensate its
   carbon emission (Spiegel online, 2007).
   Megaprojects in the growth regions of the Arabian Gulf and China
   advertise with a CO(2)-neutral balance. A Zero Carbon Community is to be
   created in Masdar, Abu Dhabi (Foster, 2007), and the first Chinese
   carbon-neutral ecocity was planned for Dongtan, Shanghai (Pearce, 2009).
   Not only to aid international communication, but also to further the
   processes required to solve energy-related problems, it is essential
   that key words, central concepts, their usage and their relationships be
   clarified. This article intends to contribute to this clarification
   based on the monitored example of a solar estate.
   Net zero energy building, equilibrium building, carbon neutral city-the
   accounting method varies, depending on motivation and point of view. If
   the focus is on finite and scarce resources, energy is the currency;
   CO(2)-equivalent emissions are considered if global warming and public
   health is the issue; the cost of energy is what concerns a tenant paying
   for heating and electricity. A balance in one set of units can be
   converted to another, but the conversion factors often also shift the
   balance point. Energy will be used as the reference quantity in the
   following article, which prevents confusion with non-energy measures
   (e.g. carbon credits for forestry) and avoids the nuclear power debate,
   in which nuclear power is partly calculated as being CO(2) neutral.
   The diversity of concepts is an indicator that a scientifically based
   methodology is still lacking, though initial publications focus hereon
   (Pless et al. 2009). Since October 2008, a group of experts in the
   International Energy Agency has been addressing this issue under the
   beading, Towards Net Zero Energy Solar Buildings (Riley et al. 2008).
   The goal is to document and analyse outstanding examples that are close
   to being net zero-energy buildings, and while doing so, to develop the
   methodology and tools for working with such buildings. The Chair of
   Technical Building Services, University of Wuppertal, is co-ordinating
   the methodological work.
   The zero-energy approach-still under construction-will here be presented
   using a solar estate as an illustration.},

Abstract = {One of the main promises of collaborative virtual environments (CVEs) is
   that they would decrease the need for travel and face-to-face meetings.
   In this study we aim at comparing the dynamics and content of group
   discussions in desktop virtual environments with physical-world
   discussions. We have conducted an experiment in which four groups of
   7-12 participants each carried out a political discussion on the same
   topic; specifically, global warming. Two groups conducted the experiment
   in a face-to-face setting and two other groups conducted a similar
   discussion inside the virtual world SecondLife
   (http://www.secondlife.com). Virtual-world discussions were found to
   include shorter sentences on average, have a smaller number of themes
   discussed, discuss a smaller number of themes in depth, and require a
   longer time for discussion threads to form. In this paper we provide a
   quantitative analysis of the similarities and differences between
   virtual-world and physical-world discussions.},

Abstract = {The paper examines the sudden disappearance in the United States of
   millions of honeybees in managed bee colonies. The major research
   undertaken in the U.S. concentrates on finding the pathogens
   responsible. This paper suggests an alternative avenue of research a)
   that as a result of global warming there is a disjunction between bees
   pollinating cycles and the life cycle of plants b) that understanding
   changes in ``timing cycles{''} as a result of global warming is the key
   to understanding the disappearance of the bees. It notes that Gregory
   Bateson argued that any condition of ecosystem collapse would be
   characterized first by a collapse in its communicative order rather,
   than from changed physical states. The collapse of bee colonies and
   demise of other pollinators is a seeming confirmation of Gregory Bateson
   argument. Honeybees are `go betweens' in ecosystemic order. It also
   argues that an appropriate topology of timing cycles and their
   recursions would enable better visual comprehension of the heterarchical
   `pattern which connects', in Bateson's phrase, and prompt awareness of
   possible catastrophe in human food supplies.},

Title = {Life cycle assessment of Australian automotive door skins},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Pages = {420-428},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Policy initiatives, such as the EU End of Life Vehicle (ELV) Directive
   for only 5\% landfilling by 2015, are increasing the pressure for higher
   material recyclability rates. This is stimulating research into material
   alternatives and end-of-life strategies for automotive components. This
   study presents a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) on an Australian automotive
   component, namely an exterior door skin. The functional unit for this
   study is one door skin set (4 exterior skins). The material alternatives
   are steel, which is currently used by Australian manufacturers,
   aluminium and glass-fiber reinforced polypropylene composite. Only the
   inputs and outputs relative to the door skin production, use and
   end-of-life phases were considered within the system boundary. Landfill,
   energy recovery and mechanical recycling were the end-of-life phases
   considered. The aim of the study is to highlight the most
   environmentally attractive material and end-of-life option.
   The LCA was performed according to the ISO 14040 standard series. All
   information considered in this study (use of fossil and non fossil based
   energy resources, water, chemicals etc.) were taken up in in-depth data.
   The data for the production, use and end-of-life phases of the door skin
   set was based upon softwares such as SimaPro and GEMIS which helped in
   the development of the inventory for the different end-of-life
   scenarios. In other cases, the inventory was developed using derivations
   obtained from published journals. Some data was obtained from GM-Holden
   and the Co-operative research Centre for Advanced Automotive Technology
   (AutoCRC), in Australia. In cases where data from the Australian economy
   was unavailable, such as the data relating to energy recovery methods, a
   generic data set based on European recycling companies was employed. The
   characterization factors used for normalization of data were taken from
   (Saling et. al. Int J Life Cycle Assess 7(4):203-218 2002) which
   detailed the method of carrying out an LCA.
   The production phase results in maximum raw material consumption for all
   materials, and it is higher for metals than for the composite. Energy
   consumption is greatest in the use phase, with maximum consumption for
   steel. Aluminium consumes most energy in the production phase. Global
   Warming Potential (GWP) also follows a trend similar to that of energy
   consumption. Photo Oxidants Creation Potential (POCP) is the highest for
   the landfill scenario for the composite, followed by steel and
   aluminium. Acidification Potential (AP) is the highest for all the
   end-of-life scenarios of the composite. Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP)
   is the highest for the metals. The net water emissions are also higher
   for composite in comparison to metals despite high pollution in the
   production phases of metallic door skins. Solid wastes are higher for
   the metallic door skins.
   The composite door skin has the lowest energy consumption in the
   production phase, due to the low energy requirements during the
   manufacturing of E-glass and its fusion with polypropylene to form sheet
   molding compounds. In general, the air emissions during the use phase
   are strongly dependent on the mass of the skins, with higher emissions
   for the metals than for the composite. Material recovery through
   recycling is the highest in metals due to efficient separation
   techniques, while mechanical recycling is the most efficient for the
   composite. The heavy steel skins produce the maximum solid wastes
   primarily due to higher fuel consumption. Water pollution reduction
   benefit is highest in case of metals, again due to the high efficiency
   of magnetic separation technique in the case of steel and eddy current
   separation technique in the case of aluminium. Material recovery in
   these metals reduces the amount of water needed to produce a new door
   skin set (water employed mainly in the ingot casting stage). Moreover,
   the use of heavy metals, inorganic salts and other chemicals is
   minimized by efficient material recovery.
   The use of the studied type of steel for the door skins is a poor
   environmental option in every impact category. Aluminium and composite
   materials should be considered to develop a more sustainable and energy
   efficient automobile. In particular, this LCA study shows that
   glass-fiber composite skins with mechanical recycling or energy recovery
   method could be environmentally desirable, compared to aluminium and
   steel skins. However, the current limit on the efficiency of recycling
   is the prime barrier to increasing the sustainability of composite
   skins.
   The study is successful in developing a detailed LCA for the three
   different types of door skin materials and their respective recycling or
   end-of-life scenarios. The results obtained could be used for future
   work on an eco-efficiency portfolio for the entire car. However, there
   is a need for a detailed assessment of toxicity and risk potentials
   arising from each of the four different types of door skin sets. This
   will require greater communication between academia and the automotive
   industry to improve the quality of the LCA data. Sensitivity analysis
   needs to be performed such as the assessment of the impact of varying
   substitution factors on the life cycle of a door skin. Incorporation of
   door skin sets made of new biomaterials need to be accounted for as
   another functional unit in future LCA studies.},

Title = {Integration of life cycle assessment in the environmental information
   system},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Pages = {364-373},

Abstract = {As the sustainability improvement becomes an essential business task of
   industry, a number of companies are adopting IT-based environmental
   information systems (EIS). Life cycle assessment (LCA), a tool to
   improve environmental friendliness of a product, can also be systemized
   as a part of the EIS. This paper presents a case of an environmental
   information system which is integrated with online LCA tool to produce
   sets of hybrid life cycle inventory and examine its usefulness in the
   field application of the environmental management.
   Samsung SDI Ltd., the producer of display panels, has launched an EIS
   called Sustainability Management Initiative System (SMIS). The system
   comprised modules of functions such as environmental management system
   (EMS), green procurement (GP), customer relation (e-VOC), eco-design,
   and LCA. The LCA module adopted the hybrid LCA methodology in the sense
   that it combines process LCA for the site processes and input-output
   (IO) LCA for upstream processes to produce cradle-to-gate LCA results.
   LCA results from the module are compared with results of other LCA
   studies made by the application of different methodologies. The
   advantages and application of the LCA system are also discussed in light
   of the electronics industry.
   LCA can play a vital role in sustainability management by finding
   environmental burden of products in their life cycle. It is especially
   true in the case of the electronics industry, since the electronic
   products have some critical public concerns in the use and end-of-life
   phase. SMIS shows a method for hybrid LCA through online data
   communication with EMS and GP module. The integration of IT-based hybrid
   LCA in environmental information system was set to begin in January
   2006. The advantage of the comparing and regular monitoring of the LCA
   value is that it improves the system completeness and increases the
   reliability of LCA. By comparing the hybrid LCA and process LCA in the
   cradle-to-gate stage, the gap between both methods of the 42-in.
   standard definition plasma display panel (PDP) ranges from 1\%
   (acidification impact category) to -282\% (abiotic resource depletion
   impact category), with an average gap of 68.63\%. The gaps of the impact
   categories of acidification (AP), eutrophication (EP), and global
   warming (GWP) are relatively low (less than 10\%). In the result of the
   comparative analysis, the strength of correlation of three impact
   categories (AP, EP, GWP) shows that it is reliable to use the hybrid LCA
   when assessing the environmental impacts of the PDP module. Hybrid LCA
   has its own risk on data accuracy. However, the risk is affordable when
   it comes to the comparative LCA among different models of similar
   product line of a company. In the results of 2 years of monitoring of
   42-in. Standard definition PDP, the hybrid LCA score has been decreased
   by 30\%. The system also efficiently shortens man-days for LCA study per
   product. This fact can facilitate the eco-design of the products and can
   give quick response to the customer's inquiry on the product's
   eco-profile. Even though there is the necessity for improvement of
   process data currently available, the hybrid LCA provides insight into
   the assessments of the eco-efficiency of the manufacturing process and
   the environmental impacts of a product.
   As the environmental concerns of the industries increase, the need for
   environmental data management also increases. LCA shall be a core part
   of the environmental information system by which the environmental
   performances of products can be controlled. Hybrid type of LCA is
   effective in controlling the usual eco-profile of the products in a
   company. For an industry, in particular electronics, which imports a
   broad band of raw material and parts, hybrid LCA is more practicable
   than the classic LCA. Continuous efforts are needed to align input data
   and keep conformity, which reduces data uncertainty of the system.},

Abstract = {CO2 ocean sequestration may be an effective option for mitigating global
   warming. There are risks associated with this process, particularly the
   local impact on deep-sea environments. Public acceptance is required for
   the implementation of this technology, even though the impacts have been

   conducted to find the correlation between public acceptance of CO2
   sequestration and influential factors by covariance structure analysis.
   In addition, risk communication via the Internet was carried out. These
   analyses revealed that careful investigation of the target oceanic site

Abstract = {Automatic meter reading (AMR) is an application implemented by power
   utilities which is becoming increasingly important in the utilities
   sector. It could be included in the more general environment of demand
   side management, which satisfies the need for more improved
   communications. AMR offers a better financial return due to the
   inclusion of other applications. Although there are several
   international standards which address AMR, most deployments are
   currently using proprietary systems. This fact may reflect that current
   standards do not fully cover this area. Since the power network reaches
   all energy meters, a convenient way to deploy AMR is to use the power
   lines as a transmission medium. The present-day situation is that there
   is mounting pressure to deploy AMR systems in a bid to provide better
   management of the energy demand in a bid to reduce global warming and
   create a more sustainable electrical system in our environmentally
   conscious society. This paper is focused on analyzing different
   standards and specifications related to AMR over powerline
   communications (PLC). Furthermore, two of them are chosen, implemented,
   and simulated using the OPNET modeler. The main goal of the implemented
   applications is to obtain comparative results of the two most known
   standard applications in AMR over PLC.},

Abstract = {Global rainfall products of high spatial and temporal resolutions have
   been provided using combined data from passive microwave (PMW) sensors
   in low Earth orbit and infrared (IR) radiometers in geostationary Earth
   orbit (GEO). This study compared six satellite rainfall estimates around
   Japan with reference to a ground-radar dataset calibrated by rain gauges
   provided by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) from January through
   December 2004. Validation results tended to be better for the products
   with temporal interpolation based upon the morphed technique using GEO
   IR information. Satellite estimates were poor for light rainfall during
   the warm season and for very heavy rainfall.
   Further analyses of satellite estimates were conducted in terms of data
   sources and surface types. Effective performance by the merger of PMW
   sounders over the ocean was verified by radar validation, in addition to
   the best results of the PMW imagers. Overall, validation results over
   the ocean were best, and results over mountainous regions were worst.
   Performance was poor over coasts and small islands, due to the problem
   of PMW retrievals. This study focused on hydrometeor profiles of
   orographic heavy rainfall over the Japanese Archipelago, which could be
   related to the poor performance of satellite estimates in very heavy
   rainfall.},

Abstract = {The increasing motivation to seek alternative sources of clean and
   sustainable energy has intensified, due to a growing awareness that
   fossil fuels are finite in quantity, and that the combustion products of
   such fuels contribute to global warming. Solar energy is considered one
   of the most readily available alternatives, but materials which are able
   to harness this form of energy need to be developed. This study details
   the development of a novel composite material, of the form of Bi/Bi-O
   nanoparticles supported on a (Nb-Ti-Si) oxide. Characterized using
   electrochemical and other methods, this material generates a
   photocurrent, and is capable of photo-oxidizing airborne-styrene in a
   fluidized-bed photoreactor when exposed to visible-light. (c) 2008

Abstract = {During recent years, Romania has experienced many floods, causing huge
   material damage and many losses of life. The paper presents in detail
   some of the main factors enhancing Nature's ``protest against global
   warming{''}: poor sewage within the towns, illegal deforestation of
   hills or Mountains slopes, dirty river banks, lack of citizens'
   education and responsibility, slow communication between different
   authorities, absence of specialized equipment, and in some cases,
   political or economical interests. Romanian authorities, having in mind
   the floods of 2005 and 2006, try to prevent these disasters or to
   mitigate their effects, but up to now there has been a big gap between
   theory and practice, mainly because of the complexity of the actions to
   be taken, which require time and money.},

Title = {Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation in Legume Nodules: Process and Signaling: A
   Review},
Booktitle = {SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2009},
Pages = {519-531},
Abstract = {The Green Revolution was accompanied by a huge increase in the
   application of fertilizers, particularly nitrogen. Recent studies
   indicate that a sizeable proportion of the human population depends on
   synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizers to provide the 53 million t N that is
   harvested globally in food crops each year. Nitrogen fertilizers affect
   the balance of the global nitrogen cycle, pollute groundwater and
   increase atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent ``greenhouse{''} gas.
   The production of nitrogen fertilizer by industrial nitrogen fixation
   not only depletes our finite reserves of fossil fuels, but also
   generates large quantities of carbon dioxide, contributing to global
   warming. The process of biological nitrogen fixation offers an
   economically attractive and ecologically sound means of reducing
   external nitrogen input and improving the quality and quantity of
   internal resources. Recent studies show that in irrigated cropping
   systems, legume N is generally less susceptible to loss processes than
   fertilizers. Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) has provided a number of
   useful paradigms for both basic and applied research. Establishing a
   fully functional symbiosis requires a successful completion of numerous
   steps that lead from recognition signals exchanged between the plant and
   bacteria to the differentiation and operation of root nodules, the plant
   organ in which nitrogen fixation takes place. The initial sensing of the
   two organisms by each other starts with the release of root exudates by
   the plant that include flavonoids and nutrients such as organic acids
   and amino acids. Flavonoids secreted by the host plant into the
   rhizosphere function as inducers of the rhizobial nod genes. nod gene
   induction results in the secretion of lipochitin oligosaccharides that
   are thought to bind to specific plant receptor kinases that contain LysM
   motifs, such as NFR1 and NFR5 in Lotus japonicus and LYK3 and LTK4 in
   Medicago truncatula. This initiates a complex signaling pathway
   involving calcium spiking in root hairs. The result is that the root
   hairs curl and trap the rhizobia, which then enter the root hair through
   tubular structures known as infection threads that are formed by the
   plant. The infection threads then grow into the developed nodule tissue.
   Ultimately, the invading bacteria are taken into the plant cell by a
   type of endocytosis in which they are surrounded by a plant-derived
   peribacteroid membrane (PBM). The resulting symbiosomes fill the plant
   cell cytoplasm and as plant and bacterial metabolism develops, the
   bacteria become mature bacteroids able to convert atmospheric nitrogen
   to ammonium. To increase knowledge of this system of particular
   importance in sustainable agriculture, major emphasis should be laid on
   the basic research. More work is needed on the genes responsible in
   rhizobia and legumes, the structural chemical bases of rhizobia/legume
   communication, and signal transduction pathways responsible for the
   finely orchestrated induction of the symbiosis-specific genes involved
   in nodule development and nitrogen fixation. This review unfolds the
   various events involved in the progression of symbiosis.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a study on the resource and environmental profile of
   leather for communicating to the consumers about the environmental
   burdens of leather products. The results indicate that significant
   environmental impacts were caused during the tanning and finishing of
   leather as well as the electricity production and transportation
   required in the life cycle. The use of fossil fuels in the production of
   energy has greater impact with increased emissions leading to about
   15190 kg CO2 equivalent of global warming and about 73 kg SO2 equivalent
   of acidification while producing 100 m(2) of leather for shoe uppers.
   Further resource use of 174 kg of coal, 6.5 kg of fuel oil, 17.4 m(3) of
   water and 348 kg of chemicals of which about 204 kg are hazardous are
   consumed, and wastewater of about 17 m(3), BOD of 55 kg, COD of about
   146 kg, TDS of 732 kg and solid waste of about 1445 kg are generated
   during the life cycle for the production of 100 m(2) of leather. The
   total solid waste generated is 1317 kg, out of which about 80\% is
   biodegradable contributed by slaughtering, tanning and finishing stage,
   14\% is non-biodegradable contributed by tanning, finishing and
   electricity production stages and 6\% is hazardous mainly from tanning
   and finishing stage of leather. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {An Application of Model Based Combustion Control to Transient
   Cycle-by-Cycle Diesel Combustion},
Journal = {SAE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Pages = {850-860},
Abstract = {From the viewpoint of the global warming restraint, reduction of exhaust
   emissions from diesel engine is urgent demand. However, it needs further
   development in combustion control besides after treatment system. Larger
   amount of EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) is effective to reduce NOx
   emission. On the other hand, incylinder physical conditions greatly
   influence on selfignition and combustion process, especially low O2
   fraction charged gas owing to excessive EGR causes misfire. A drastic
   solution for this problem, fuel injection timing should be optimally
   manipulated based on predicted ignition delay period before actual
   injection.
   For this purpose, Toyota has developed a model based diesel combustion
   control concept to avoid the misfire and to keep low emission combustion
   includes in transient condition. The feed-forward self-ignition timing
   controller consists of the intake gas O2 fraction estimation model, the
   ignition timing prediction model, and the fuel injection timing finding
   function. On each cycle, the ignition timing prediction model makes a
   relational expression between fuel injection timing and predicted
   ignition timing. And the injection timing finding function finds the
   required injection timing to meet selfignition timing to its target by
   using the expression. In the experiment, the controller prevents the
   transient excessive ignition delay, and the torque response and HC
   emission is improved. As a consequence, the control concept has been
   realized as a practical on-board control technology.},

Abstract = {Following the effectuation of Kyoto Protocol in 2005, global warming
   began to receive a lot of attention worldwide and the role of green IT
   in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) has become an important global issue.
   Korea, a late starter in this business, has also implemented several
   strategies and policies mostly led by government. However, there is
   currently no inventory system in Korean telecommunication sector that
   can categorize the GHG sinks/emission sources and emission
   amount/removed amount and manage them during the total procedure. Hence,
   this paper examines the green IT activities of developed countries and
   available inventory guidelines, with a purpose of suggesting direction
   for establishing inventory that fits the domestic situation. Such
   inventory system will contribute to building a fundamental stone for low
   carbon green growth in Korea and expanding Korean green IT technological
   share in global market.},

Abstract = {With the increasing concern for global warming, the impact of Internet
   power consumption is gaining interest. In this paper, we explore, for
   the first time, the relationship between network robustness, performance
   and Internet power consumption. We first discuss such a relationship
   based on data collected from Internet sources. Next, we propose a
   modeling framework to size that relationship.
   It is shown that when designing networks based on power consumption,
   careful attention should be paid to the trade-off between energy
   consumption and network performance since doing otherwise would lead to
   unreliable networks.},

Title = {Carbon Stocks in Different Soil Types under Diverse Rainfed Production

Abstract = {Soil carbon (C) pool plays a crucial role in the soil's quality,
   availability of plant nutrients, environmental functions, and global C
   cycle. Drylands generally have poor fertility and little organic matter
   and hence are candidates for C sequestration. Carbon storage in the soil
   profile not only improves fertility but also abates global warming.
   Several soils, production, and management factors influence C
   sequestration, and it is important to identify production and management
   factors that enhance C sequestrations in dryland soils. The objective of
   the present study was to examine C stocks at 21 sites under ongoing
   rainfed production systems and management regimes over the last 25 years
   on dominant soil types, covering a range of climatic conditions in
   India. Organic C stocks in the soil profiles across the country showed
   wide variations and followed the order Vertisols Inceptisols Alfisols
   Aridisols. Inorganic C and total C stocks were larger in Vertisols than
   in other soil types. Soil organic C stocks decreased with depth in the
   profile, whereas inorganic C stocks increased with depth. Among the
   production systems, soybean-, maize-, and groundnut-based systems showed
   greater organic C stocks than other production systems. However, the
   greatest contribution of organic C to total C stock was under upland
   rice system. Organic C stocks in the surface layer of the soils
   increased with rainfall (r = 0.59{*}), whereas inorganic C stocks in
   soils were found in the regions with less than 550mm annual rainfall.
   Cation exchange capacity had better correlation with organic C stocks
   than clay content in soils. Results suggest that Indian dryland soils
   are low in organic C but have potential to sequester. Further potential
   of tropical soils to sequester more C in soil could be harnessed by
   identifying appropriate production systems and management practices for
   sustainable development and improved livelihoods in the tropics.},

Abstract = {Dynamic spectrum management (DSM) has been recognized as a key
   technology for tackling multi-user crosstalk interference for DSL
   broadband access. Up to now, DSM design has mainly been focusing on
   maximization of data rates. However, recently, reducing the total power
   has become a main target, as IT power consumption has been identified as
   a significant contributor to global warming. In this paper we extend
   traditional DSM design towards a much wider energy-efficient scope and
   show how to tackle the corresponding optimization problems. The impact
   of this `green DSL' approach is evaluated for practice with some
   surprisingly good numerical results. Furthermore bounds are provided on
   the trade-off between data rate performance and power saving.},

Abstract = {Phenomena like, atmospheric pollution, temperature variability, global
   warming, or ozone layer depletion (OLD) may be analyzed for forecasts
   etc. by solving the primitive dynamic equations along with the
   continuity and energy ones. The environmental variables actually
   observed are the consequences of thousand of events, some of which may
   be poorly defined or imperfectly understood. However, such atmospheric
   models of meteorological phenomena are simplistic in their nature, in
   the sense of largely hiding the character of nature as it `really' is.
   This failure of reaching an exact solution and the fact that
   environmental phenomena nearly always include random components prompt
   us to leave the purely deterministic approach and invoke instead
   pseudo-randomness or randomness (stochasticity).
   In globally coupled dynamical systems, the law of large numbers is
   violated but the central limit theorem holds. The ozone reduction is
   predictable and models can be used to provide predictions of OLD due to
   human activities. One may argue that the consistency resulting from
   model application - such as the ability to describe the OLD and its
   seasonal variations, the reproducibility of predictions, and reasonable
   consistency between different models - could be a property of the models
   rather than of the OLD. For instance consider the Milankovitch forcing
   arising from changes in the distribution of solar radiation over the
   Earth because of variations in the Earth's orbit. If we turn to the past
   record of OLD we see that changes in ozone as a result of the increase
   of CFCs are also driven by changes in the radiative regime at the top of
   the atmosphere.
   This study attempts time series modeling via fluctuating dynamics of
   ozone layer for the study of OLD which has not been attempted earlier.
   Our investigations produce quantitative results that describe the
   relation of synoptic meteorological conditions to regional OLD. In this
   communication analysis of bispectrum properties, correlation dimension
   and lyapunov exponent for fluctuating OLD phenomenon have been carried
   out in order to test the existence of some degree of chaos in discrete
   time series. This analysis, based on the study of correlation
   properties, can be considered as a first contribution in understanding
   the fluctuating dynamics of OLD phenomenon in order to obtain a coherent
   representation of this complex dynamical system.},

Abstract = {The field of photonics starts with the efficient generation of light.
   The generation of efficient yet highly controllable light can indeed be
   accomplished with light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which are, in principle,
   capable of generating white light with a 20 times greater efficiency
   than conventional light bulbs. Deployed on a global scale to replace
   conventional sources, such solid-state light sources will result in
   enormous benefits that, over a period of 10 years, include (1) gigantic
   energy savings of 1.9 x 10(20) joule, (2) a very substantial reduction
   in global-warming CO2 emissions, (3) a strong reduction in the emission
   of pollutants such as acid-rain-causing SO2, mercury (Hg), and uranium
   (U), and (4) financial savings exceeding a trillion (10(12)) US\$. These
   benefits can be accomplished by the ``replacement paradigm{''} in which
   conventional light sources are replaced by more energy efficient, more
   durable, and non-toxic light sources. However, it will be shown that
   solid-state light sources can go beyond the replacement paradigm, by
   providing new capabilities including the control of spectrum, color
   temperature, polarization, temporal modulation, and spatial emission
   pattern. We will show that such future, ``smart{''} light sources, can
   harness the huge potential of LEDs by offering multi-dimensional
   controllability that will enhance the functionality and performance of
   light sources in a wide range of applications. These applications
   include optical microscopy, imaging, display technologies,
   communications, networking, and transportation systems. (C) 2008 Optical

Abstract = {Global warming is mainly caused by CO2 emission from thermal power
   plants, which burn fossil fuel with air. One of the countermeasure
   technologies to prevent global warming is CO2 recovery from combustion
   flue gas and the,sequestration of CO2 underground or in the ocean. SOFC
   and other fuel cells call produce high-concentration CO2, because the
   reformed fuel gas reacts with oxygen electrochemically Without being
   mixed with air, or diluted by N-2. Thus, we propose to operate the
   multistage SOFCs under high utilization of reformed fuel for obtaining
   high-concentration CO2. In this report, we have estimated the multistage
   SOFCs' performance considering H-2 diffusion and the combined cycle
   efficiency of multistage SOFC/gas turbine/CO2 recovery power plant. The
   power generation efficiency of our CO2 recovery combined cycle is 68.5\%
   and the efficiency of conventional SOFC/GT cycle is 57.8\% including the
   CO2 recovery airline process. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Electron

Title = {Toward elimination of the warm bias in historic radiosonde temperature
   records - Some new results from a comprehensive intercomparison of
   upper-air data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {21},

Abstract = {The apparent cooling trend in observed global mean temperature series
   from radiosonde records relative to Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU)
   radiances has been a long-standing problem in upper-air climatology. It
   is very likely caused by a warm bias of radiosonde temperatures in the
   1980s, which has been reduced over time with better instrumentation and
   correction software. The warm bias in the MSU-equivalent lower
   stratospheric (LS) layer is estimated as 0.6 +/- 0.3 K in the global
   mean and as 1.0 +/- 0.3 K in the tropical (20 degrees S-20 degrees N)
   mean. These estimates are based on comparisons of unadjusted radiosonde
   data, not only with MSU data but also with background forecast (BG)
   temperature time series from the 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range
   Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40) and with two new
   homogenized radiosonde datasets. One of the radiosonde datasets
   {[}Radiosonde Observation Correction using Reanalyses (RAOBCORE) version
   1.4] employs the BG as reference for homogenization, which is not
   strictly independent of MSU data. The second radiosonde dataset uses the
   dates of the breakpoints detected by RAOBCORE as metadata for
   homogenization. However, it relies only on homogeneous segments of
   neighboring radiosonde data for break-size estimation. Therefore,
   adjustments are independent of satellite data.
   Both of the new adjusted radiosonde time series are in better agreement
   with satellite data than comparable published radiosonde datasets, not
   only for zonal means but also at most single stations. A robust warming
   maximum of 0.2-0.3K ( 10 yr)(-1) for the 1979-2006 period in the
   tropical upper troposphere could be found in both homogenized radiosonde
   datasets. The maximum is consistent with mean temperatures of a thick
   layer in the upper troposphere and upper stratosphere (TS), derived from
   M3U3 radiances. Inferred from these results is that it is possible to
   detect and remove most of the mean warm bias from the radiosonde
   records, and thus most of the trend discrepancy compared to MSU LS and
   TS temperature products.
   The comprehensive intercomparison also suggests that the BG is
   temporally quite homogeneous after 1986. Only in the early 1980s could
   some inhomogeneities in the BG be detected and quantified.},

Abstract = {Promotion of public transport usage and discouraging the use of cars and
   other private transports improves the environment (i.e. safety, exhaust
   emissions, noise) and contributes to reduce the problem of global
   warming. This paper suggests a new cost-effective idea to locate a
   vehicle in public transport domain and compares proposed technique to
   some of the methods advised previously to find the location of a
   vehicle. This paper further proposes a framework that is inspired by the
   thematic layers of a GIS (Geographic Information System). Proposed
   transportation GIS works as a visualization tool and helps to process
   spatio-temporal queries.
   Building such a system will first of all require a strategy to keep
   track of vehicles in specific public transport, a client interface, and
   a query processing system to handle spatial and temporal queries put up
   by the users of the transport system. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Born in the fifties together with the emergence of the nuclear
   technologies, radioecology is a scientific discipline that primarily
   addresses environmental issues relevant to radioprotection. With a
   current membership of nearly 600 worldwide, the International Union of
   Radioecology was founded in the seventies as a non-governmental knowing
   society dedicated to the development and the promotion of this
   discipline. The scientific directions taken in Radioecology have been
   drastically influenced in the past by the Chernobyl accident, which
   forced a focus on environmental transfers through the environment to
   feed human radioprotection needs. Currently, a profound evolution is
   underway towards more ecological effects research and studies, under the
   driving pressure of the raise of society's concern oil environmental
   issues and the concomitant re-boost of nuclear industry to face global
   warming and the future energetic demands. The IUR plays a central role
   within this evolution which is described here in more details along a
   description of its four major tools of action: dedicated task groups;
   workshops, seminars and conferences; training courses; web site tool for
   information and communication. Finally, together with the recent
   election of a new Board of Council to the Union, the main lines of the
   new strategic plan for the coming years are given.},

Title = {Ethical rooms for Maneuver and their prospects Vis-A-vis the current

Abstract = {In this paper I want to show that consumer concerns can be implemented
   in food chains by organizing ethical discussions of conflicting values
   that include them as participators. First, it is argued that there are
   several types of consumer concerns about food and agriculture that are
   multi-interpretable and often contradict each other or are at least
   difficult to reconcile without considerable loss. Second, these consumer
   concerns are inherently dynamic because they respond to difficult and
   complex societal and technological situations and developments. For
   example, because of the rising concern with global warming, carbon
   dioxide absorption of crops is now attracting public attention, which
   means that new requirements are being proposed for the environmentally
   friendly production of crops. Third, there are different types of
   consumers, and their choices between conflicting values differ
   accordingly. Consumers use different weighing models and various types
   of information in making their food choices. Changing food chains more
   in accordance with consumer concerns should at least take into account
   the multi-interpretable, dynamic, and pluralist features of consumer
   concerns, for example, in traceability schemes. In discussing usual
   approaches such as codes, stakeholder analysis, and assurance schemes, I
   conclude that these traditional approaches can be helpful. However, in
   cases of dynamic, pluralistic, and uncertain developments, maintaining
   some pre-existing evaluating scheme or some clear cut normative
   hierarchy, such as codes or assurance schemes, can be disastrous in
   undermining new ethical desirable initiatives. Instead of considering
   ethical standards and targets as fixed, which is done with codes and
   schemes, it is more fruitful to emphasize the structure of the processes
   in which ethical weighing of relevant consumer concerns get shaped. The
   concept of ``Ethical Room for Maneuver{''} (ERM) is constructed to
   specify the ethical desirable conditions under which identification and
   weighing of paramount values and their dilemmas can be processed. The
   main aims of the ERM are making room in all the links of the food chain
   for regulating and implementing the relevant consumer concerns by (1)
   balancing and negotiating, (2) supporting information systems that are
   relevant and communicative for various consumer groups and (3)
   organizing consumer involvement in the links of the food chain. The
   social and political context of agriculture and food production,
   particularly in Europe, gives ample opportunity for implementing several
   types of Ethical Rooms for Maneuver. Finally, I discuss several types of
   Ethical Rooms for Manoeuvre in the food chains that can be communicated
   by means of specific traceability schemes to less involved stakeholders
   with the potential consequence that the stakeholders will be motivated
   to be more involved.},

Abstract = {In recent years, distributed generation, as clean natural energy
   generation and cogeneration system of high thermal efficiency, has
   increased due to the problems of global warming and exhaustion of fossil
   fuels. Many of the distributed generations are set up in the vicinity of
   the customer, with the advantage that this decreases transmission
   losses. However, output power generated from natural energy, such as
   wind power, photovoltaics, etc., which is distributed generation, is
   influenced by meteorological conditions. Therefore, when the distributed
   generation increases by conventional control techniques, it is expected
   that the voltage change of each node becomes a problem. Proposed in this
   paper is the optimal control of distribution voltage with coordination
   of distributed installations, such as the load ratio control
   transformer, step voltage regulator (SVR), shunt capacitor, shunt
   reactor, and static var compensator. In this research, SVR is assumed to
   be a model with tap changing where the signal is received from a central
   control unit. Moreover, the communication infrastructure in the supply
   of a distribution system is assumed to be widespread. The genetic
   algorithm is used to determine the operation of this control. In order
   to confirm the validity of the proposed method, simulations are carried
   out for a distribution network model with distributed generation
   (photovoltaic generation).},

Abstract = {We described and analyzed the capacity of a community to adapt to the
   impacts of a tsunami on their livelihoods. We looked at the community's
   responses to the impacts of the tsunami and the factors that influenced
   its adaptive capacity. Based on this analysis, we present a number of
   lessons learned that are meant to enhance the adaptive capacity and
   resilience of communities to the impacts of sudden disasters, such as a
   tsunami, or a slow-building catastrophe, such as global warming. The
   study community consisted of two village groups in an island community
   named Koh Yao Noi in southern Thailand that sustained losses to its
   resources and means of livelihood from the Indian Ocean tsunami of 26
   December 2004. The Intergovernmental Organization of the Network of
   Aquaculture Centres in Asia-Pacific selected the community as a study
   site in order to gain a border understanding of the effects of external
   assistance provided for livelihoods recovery and long-term development.
   The various actions by the community demonstrate a longer-term view of
   rehabilitation than the immediate benefits available from aid. During
   the rehabilitation period, the community exhibited self-reliance, broad
   participation in decision making, trustworthiness, the ability to find
   opportunities opened up by the assistance without being opportunistic,
   and concern for the worse-off among their ranks. Collective action
   characterized the way the community utilized and took advantage of the
   opportunities presented by external assistance.
   An analysis of the factors that contributed to the community's
   resilience and adaptive capacities indicates the importance of social
   capital or assets. This finding was the basis for the three lessons
   drawn from the study: (1) a strong social asset enabled the community to
   effectively mitigate the impacts of the disaster on their other
   livelihood assets, (2) resiliency and better adaptive capacity can be
   enhanced by the creation of diverse social networks, and (3) resiliency
   can be increased by developing redundancy to manage risk. These lessons
   suggested a number of practical measures, namely fostering organized
   groups, mutual assistance or self-help clusters, and formal
   associations; facilitating the establishment of functional linkages,
   working relations, and communication links between organized community
   groups and appropriate external bodies but in a way in which the
   relations are a partnership rather than a donor-recipient relationship;
   and enhancing, with training and other measures, group decision-making
   skills in planning and solving community problems to make the community
   a stronger partner to the local government as well as to avoid being
   overly dependent on government for decisions on community matters.
   The broader policy implications of the study include a set of
   recommendations for developing postdisaster adaption measures based on
   local livelihoods and livelihood assets and for integrating
   community-level adaptation activities into national policy processes.},

Abstract = {Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is becoming of increasing
   interest to many stakeholders, including utilities, regulators, energy
   markets, and a society concerned about conserving energy and responding
   to global warming. AMI technologies, rapidly overtaking the earlier
   Automated Meter Reading (AMR) technologies, are being developed by many
   vendors, with portions being developed by metering manufacturers,
   communications providers, and back-office Meter Data Management (MDM) IT
   vendors.
   In this flurry of excitement, very little effort has yet been focused on
   the cyber security of AMI systems. The comment usually is ``Oh yes, we
   will encrypt everything - that will make everything secure. ``That
   comment indicates unawareness of possible security threats of AMI - a
   technology that will reach into a large majority of residences and
   virtually all commercial and industrial customers. What if for instance,
   remote connect/disconnect were included as one AMI capability - a
   function of great interest to many utilities as it avoids truck rolls.
   What if a smart kid hacker in his basement cracked the security of his
   AMI system, and sent out 5 million disconnect commands to all customer
   meters on the AMI system...?},

Abstract = {A major contribution to global warming has been the number of new
   workshops publishing proceedings with the prefix hot. In this article, I
   propose that we counter this trend in an attempt to remain carbon
   neutral with a set of ``anti-workshops{''} on cold topics.
   We suggest a number of heuristics for detecting when a topic has gone
   cold, and give some examples of the application of these heuristics. Of
   course, some cold topics warm up again, and so there is a risk of over
   dampering in our heuristic. Over a long period, dynamic equilibrium
   should be assured, but from time to time, our scheme may prejudice
   against surprising results in boring areas of communications research.
   Nevertheless, it may leave room for more surprising results in
   interesting areas of research, which cannot be a bad thing.},

Abstract = {The world is ``becoming flat{''} (Friedman, 2005), this means that
   innovations are emerging thanks to the deployment of new open
   collaborative frameworks and Information and Communication Technologies
   that enable the development of new products and services. Additionally,
   there are two key emerging trends changing the business arena: 1) the
   fast development, of economics, such as China and India that besides low
   cost opportunities also represent new attractive markets counting
   together with more than 2 billion people and which at the same little
   are investing to improve their innovation capabilities and 2) the
   acknowledgement of the latent worldwide need to care not only about
   economic returns, but also about the social welfare of human beings, in
   whichever market they live, and the impact that any type of organisation
   has oil the environment to diminish worries such as global warming,
   energy consumption and waste. Therefore, the goal of this paper is
   twofold: 1) propose a sustainable innovation framework that integrates
   four key enablers and 2) explain how this framework was applied ill file
   SWISSMAIN project to assess and compare seven identified scenarios to
   enable Swiss and Indian firms to collaborate towards new business
   opportunities considering economic, social and environmental impacts..},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose participatory gaming simulation that is used
   for science communication at the science cafe or science workshop. In
   general, there is a short talk by an invited speaker on a new or
   controversial science-related topic at the science cafe. And followed by
   a discussion, the audience gets the chance to ask any questions they may
   have. However, the audiences, who are ordinary citizens, don't have
   enough technical knowledge about the topics, so it is not easy to
   understand the complicated scientific issues. To help solve the problem,
   we have been working to develop participatory gaming simulation as
   educational communication tools. In this paper, we report the findings
   of an analysis of a science communication trial using participatory
   gaming simulation that deals with global warming.},

Abstract = {Renewable Energy production is becoming more important day by day due to
   a rapid increase for reliable, sufficient, timely, and economic and
   environmentally energy production. Public awareness about environment
   has a great impact on choosing the renewable resources for the renewable
   based electricity production systems. The Commission on Environment of
   the Turkish Grand National Assembly approved the Kyoto Protocol on
   Global Warming in June 2008, which makes the importance of renewable
   energy one step more important for Turkey. When all the potential
   renewable energy sources of Turkey is considered, hydraulic and wind and
   solar energies can meet almost 1/3 of the total demand and a very high
   percentage of the electricity production in the country. However
   country-wide planning of production and distribution is vital just
   because the potential of renewable resources diversed among the
   geographical regions and according to the time of the year in Turkey.
   The current structure of Turkey's energy policies, latest developments,
   and renewable energy potentials has analyzed. For planning and
   distribution scenarios five different regions of Turkey is used for
   sample data in means of wind, hydro and solar renewable energy
   potentials. A road map and a fuzzy expert system for a possible planning
   and distribution road map has been proposed.},

Abstract = {Ranking methods are of great importance for assessing the relative
   importance or potential impact of different objects, e.g. chemicals,
   screening methods, etc. When a ranking procedure is applied it is
   desired to obtain a total order of the ranked objects. With most
   methods, this is achieved through the mathematical combination of
   descriptors characterising the objects, often under the inclusion of
   descriptor priorities. However, such priority settings affect the final
   ranking and the contribution of each descriptor to the final result
   becomes obscure. In this paper, METEOR (Method of evaluation by order
   theory) is described, a ranking procedure which allows to explore the
   complete space of possible descriptor priorities in such a way that
   total orders are obtained. METEOR permits 1) to study the total order
   resulting from any descriptors' prioritisation, 2) to determine the
   priorities necessary to obtain a particular total order, 3) to calculate
   the probability of having a particular total order, and 4) to calculate
   the similarity between different total orders. METEOR is applied to 18
   refrigerants used in the past, presently used, and some proposed
   substitutes, characterised by their ozone depletion potentials, global
   warming potentials and atmospheric lifetimes. The results show that
   pentafluorodimethyl ether, a proposed replacement for the problematic
   fully halogenated refrigerants, has a probability of 68 \% of being an
   environmentally problematic substance of the selection of refrigerants
   considered in this paper.},

Abstract = {In recent years, distributed generation, as clean natural energy
   generation and cogeneration system or high thermal efficiency, has
   increased due to the problems of global warming and exhaustion of fossil
   fuels. Many of the distributed generations are set up in the vicinity of
   the customer, with the advantage that this decreases transmission
   losses. However, output power generated from natural energy such as wind
   power, photovoltaics, etc, which is distributed generation, is
   influenced by meteorological conditions. Therefore when the distributed
   generation increases by conventional control techniques, it is expected
   that the voltage change of each node becomes a problem.
   Proposed in this paper is optimal control of distribution voltage with
   coordination of distributed installations, such as Load Ratio Control
   Transformer (LRT), Step Voltage Regulator (SVR), Shunt Capacitor (SC),
   Shunt Reactor (ShR), and Static Var Compensator (SVC). In this research,
   SVR is assumed to be a model with tap changing where the signal is
   received from a central control unit. Moreover, the communication
   infrastructure in the supply of the distribution system Is assumed to be
   widespread. The technique proposed in this paper combines a Genetic
   Algorithm (GA) and Tabu search (TS) to determine the control operation.
   In order to confirm the validity of the proposed method, simulations are
   carried out for a the distribution network model with distributed
   (photovoltaic) generation.},

Abstract = {Global Climat changes and global worming influence the marine
   environment. Warming of the sea water may result in excessive algae
   blooming. A novel ZigBee based buoy platform was developed, that allows
   temperature monitoring with high spatial resolution. Each buoy appears
   as a node in a large network - direct communication with the network
   coordinator is not needed thus powerful tranmitters can be substituted
   by, relatively, low power ZigBit Amp modules {[}Meshnetics]. First
   prototypes were manufactured and undergo now, an extensive field test in
   the Tyrrhenian Sea (Italy).},

Abstract = {In recent years, distributed generation based on natural energy or using
   co-generation system is increasing due to the problems of global warming
   and exhaustion of fossil fuels. Many of the distributed generations are

   Voltage Regulator (SVR), Shunt Capacitor (SC), Shunt Reactor (ShR), and
   Static Var Compensator (SVC). Neural Network (NN) is used to determine
   the operation of the control device. The optimal data is created by
   Genetic Algorithm. By using the optimal data for training of NN, the
   operation of the control device can approach the optimal operation
   without the communication infrastructures. Furthermore, the
   decentralized control has the merit of robustness against faults of

Abstract = {Unicellular green algae have the ability to operate in two distinctly
   different environments (aerobic and anaerobic), and to
   photosynthetically generate molecular hydrogen (H-2). A recently
   developed metabolic protocol in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
   permitted separation of photosynthetic O-2-evolution and carbon
   accumulation from anaerobic consumption of cellular metabolites and
   concomitant photosynthetic H-2-evolution. The H-2 evolution process was
   induced upon sulfate nutrient deprivation of the cells, which reversibly
   inhibits photosystem-II and O-2-evolution in their chloroplast. In the
   absence of O-2, and in order to generate ATP, green algae resorted to
   anaerobic photosynthetic metabolism, evolved H-2 in the light and
   consumed endogenous substrate. This study summarizes recent advances on
   green algal hydrogen metabolism and discusses avenues of research for
   the further development of this method. Included is the mechanism of a
   substantial tenfold starch accumulation in the cells, observed promptly
   upon S-deprivation, and the regulated starch and protein catabolism
   during the subsequent H-2-evolution. Also discussed is the function of a
   chloroplast envelope-localized sulfate permease, and the
   photosynthesis-respiration relationship in green algae as potential
   tools by which to stabilize and enhance H-2 metabolism. In addition to
   potential practical applications of H-2, approaches discussed in this
   work are beginning to address the biochemistry of anaerobic H-2
   photoproduction, its genes, proteins, regulation, and communication with
   other metabolic pathways in microalgae. Photosynthetic H-2 production by
   green algae may hold the promise of generating a renewable fuel from
   nature's most plentiful resources, sunlight and water. The process
   potentially concerns global warming and the question of energy supply
   and demand.},

Abstract = {These two experiments compare perceptions of local, national, and
   Internet news articles on two U.S. environmental policy issues: oil
   drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and ratification of the
   Kyoto treaty on global warming. Of interest were the potential effects
   of perceived article reach and slant oil estimates of public support for
   different policy alternatives. While perceived slant proved to be a
   fairly robust predictor of public opinion estimates, support for all
   effect of perceived reach was mixed. Deconstructing perceived media
   reach into access and exposure assumptions should produce all opinion
   inference model that is more sensitive to the differing influences of
   local, national, and Internet uezvs as consumption patterns evolve.},

Title = {Symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legume nodules: process and signaling. A

Abstract = {The Green Revolution was accompanied by a huge increase in the
   application of fertilizers, particularly nitrogen. Recent studies
   indicate that a sizeable proportion of the human population depends on
   synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizers to provide the 53 million t N that is
   harvested globally in food crops each year. Nitrogen fertilizers affect
   the balance of the global nitrogen cycle, pollute groundwater and
   increase atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent ``greenhouse{''} gas.
   The production of nitrogen fertilizer by industrial nitrogen fixation
   not only depletes our finite reserves of fossil fuels, but also
   generates large quantities of carbon dioxide, contributing to global
   warming. The process of biological nitrogen fixation offers an
   economically attractive and ecologically sound means of reducing
   external nitrogen input and improving the quality and quantity of
   internal resources. Recent studies show that in irrigated cropping
   systems, legume N is generally less susceptible to loss processes than
   fertilizers. Biological nitrogen fixation ( BNF) has provided a number
   of useful paradigms for both basic and applied research. Establishing a
   fully functional symbiosis requires a successful completion of numerous
   steps that lead from recognition signals exchanged between the plant and
   bacteria to the differentiation and operation of root nodules, the plant
   organ in which nitrogen fixation takes place. The initial sensing of the
   two organisms by each other starts with the release of root exudates by
   the plant that include flavonoids and nutrients such as organic acids
   and amino acids. Flavonoids secreted by the host plant into the
   rhizosphere function as inducers of the rhizobial nod genes. nod gene
   induction results in the secretion of lipochitin oligosaccharides that
   are thought to bind to specific plant receptor kinases that contain LysM
   motifs, such as NFR1 and NFR5 in Lotus japonicus and LYK3 and LTK4 in
   Medicago truncatula. This initiates a complex signaling pathway
   involving calcium spiking in root hairs. The result is that the root
   hairs curl and trap the rhizobia, which then enter the root hair through
   tubular structures known as infection threads that are formed by the
   plant. The infection threads then grow into the developed nodule tissue.
   Ultimately, the invading bacteria are taken into the plant cell by a
   type of endocytosis in which they are surrounded by a plant-derived
   peribacteroid membrane (PBM). The resulting symbiosomes fill the plant
   cell cytoplasm and as plant and bacterial metabolism develops, the
   bacteria become mature bacteroids able to convert atmospheric nitrogen
   to ammonium. To increase knowledge of this system of particular
   importance in sustainable agriculture, major emphasis should be laid on
   the basic research. More work is needed on the genes responsible in
   rhizobia and legumes, the structural chemical bases of rhizobia/legume
   communication, and signal transduction pathways responsible for the
   finely orchestrated induction of the symbiosis-specific genes involved
   in nodule development and nitrogen fixation. This review unfolds the
   various events involved in the progression of symbiosis.},

Abstract = {One of the contributing factors to global warming problem is the
   deforestation. Tools mostly used in this vast destruction of forest are
   chainsaw. Chainsaw has a quite unique acoustic characteristic that can
   be detected with high accuracy. To prevent and deter the deforestation,
   wireless sensor nodes can be deployed to detect the activity of
   chainsawing. However, to the best knowledge of author, there is no paper
   addressing this issue. In this paper, we present the algorithm suitable
   for limited energy sensor node to detect chainsaw. Aiming for low
   complexity and workable in real world, the algorithm combines three
   simple techniques: (1) Adaptive Energy Threshold, (2) Delta Pitch
   Detection and (3) Energy Band Ratio. Performance results show that this
   algorithm is able to achieve detection accuracy about 90\%.},

Abstract = {8.2 terawatt hours of electrical energy is consumed per year by NTT
   group companies. This huge amount of energy is used, for example, for
   fixed telecommunications, mobile communications, and data centers. As
   network equipment has become more IP-based, the energy consumption
   required has steadily increased. We have implemented various
   energy-saving measures to prevent global warming. We introduce the
   actions we are taking on the strategy of ``Green integration.{''}
   ``Green integration{''} is not limited to telecommunications, and it is
   a set of solutions that contributes to the environment in terms of
   energy and structure.},

Abstract = {A simulation model was used to illustrate logical outcomes of four
   scenarios of a future New Zealand up to 50 years hence. These scenarios
   were defined in consultation with government policy-makers using a range
   of qualitative driving forces: New Zealand governance, identity and
   social cohesion; and impacts of technology choices; and rates of
   resource use. Scenarios include independent projections of key social,
   economic, and environmental variables.
   The model has been designed to evaluate the interactions between these
   variables and to facilitate understanding, communication, and
   participation between stakeholders, social scientists, and modellers.
   This paper describes the overall structure of the model, linkages
   between the various modules, and early modelling results. The model
   provides a flexible framework that can be used by stakeholders to test
   parameter values and relationships and the direct and indirect effects
   of parameters on the economy and the environment. The model has three
   independent modules running sequentially. The population module is a
   dynamic simulation model with 5-year age-sex cohorts. It outputs the
   population size and composition for each year until 2050. The labour
   force module applies assumed age-and sex-specific participation rates to
   the working-age population of each scenario. This module yields Full
   Time Equivalent (FTE) employment levels that are used as an input to the
   next module. The Environment-Economy module is based on a simplified
   Social Accounting Matrix for the New Zealand economy and estimates the
   environmental pressures of energy use and global warming potential (GWP)
   associated with economic activity and households.
   Parameters estimated for each scenario included: fertility, mortality,
   migration, labour participation and unemployment rates; household
   expenditure and exports profiles; productivity, capital structure and
   environmental pressures changes. Results for one of the four scenarios
   ({''}Independent Aotearoa{''}) are presented in this paper.
   Under this scenario the modelled total population increases from 3.9m in
   2001 to 5m in 2050. The population will age considerably, with people
   older than 65 increasing from 12\% in 2001 to 21\% in 2050, increasing
   the 65+ dependency ratio from 1: 4 in 2001 to almost 1: 2 in 2050. Given
   labour force and productivity growth, GDP increases from \$111billion in
   2001 to 229\$NZ2001billion in 2050. There is a significant relative
   shift from primary and manufacturing sectors to services and the public
   sector in comparison to the 2001economic structure.
   While energy use per capita decreases in comparison with 2001, there is
   an increase in the total use of fuels and electricity driven by
   population growth and increased economic activity. Total energy use
   increases 10\%, from 473PJ in 2001 to 520PJ in 2050. However, most of
   the electricity is by then generated from renewable sources, resulting
   in an 8\% decrease on Energy generated CO2 emissions, from 25Gg in 2001
   to 23Gg in 2050. Green house gas (GHG) emissions decrease in 2050 due to
   reduced agricultural activities and technological change. As a result
   the total GWP decreased 9\%, from 45Gg in 2001 to 41Gg in 2050.
   Although limited, this first version of the New Zealand Dynamic
   Ecological-Economic Model (NZDEEM) has provided a tool that can be used
   to provide a `more holistic view' of basic interactions between
   simplified social, economic, and environmental systems. Furthermore, a
   number of potential interpretation errors and omissions with the
   narrative scenarios and the quantitative model came to light through the
   modelling process. Thus NZDEEM has proved useful in providing common
   ground between modellers and social scientists to generate the critical
   debate that refines both models and narratives.},

Title = {Nurses' and patients' perceptions of expert palliative nursing care},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {54},
Number = {6},
Pages = {700-709},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Aim. This paper reports a study of the perceptions of patients and
   nurses of palliative care and, in particular, the concept of the expert
   palliative nurse.
   Background. Palliative care is a growing speciality and is practised
   globally. There is, however, limited information on patients' views
   about palliative care. While the idea of expertise in nursing is not
   new, few studies have explored the concept of the expert nurse in
   palliative care. Some evidence exists on palliative nurses' perceptions
   of their care, that it is supportive and involves maintaining
   therapeutic relationships with patients. Facing a terminal illness has
   been identified as a stressful and fearful experience that affects all
   aspects of life. It has also been revealed that dying patients may have
   unmet care needs, mainly in the areas of pain and symptom control,
   emotional support, and spending time alone.
   Methods. A phenomenological study was carried out, using in-depth
   interviews and thematic content analysis. A convenience sample of 22
   Registered Nurses and 22 dying patients was interviewed in 1996-1997.
   Findings. Dying patients had a desire to maintain independence and
   remain in control. Palliative care nurses experienced both effective and
   ineffective interpersonal communication, the building of therapeutic
   relationships with dying patients and attempting to control patients'
   pain and distressing symptoms. Patients and nurses agreed that the two
   most important characteristics of an expert palliative nurse were
   interpersonal skills and qualities such as kindness, warmth, compassion
   and genuineness.
   Conclusion. Although the study was conducted in the United Kingdom, the
   findings have relevance for palliative care practice globally in terms
   of dependence, issues of patient choice, nurses being interpersonally
   skilled and building therapeutic relationships with patients.},

Abstract = {Venice risks to be submerged as a consequence of two problems: local
   land subsidence and sea level rise due to global warming. They both
   contribute to what is referred as Apparent Sea Level Rise (ASLR).
   Flooding Tides (locally: Acqua Alta) submerge Venice with an
   exponentially increasing frequency. The Acqua Alta is generated by a
   number of factors, the main of them being the Sirocco wind blowing over
   the Adriatic Sea, that ultimately displaces waters towards Venice. These
   extreme events have been investigated by using the documentary
   description of past floods, accurately reported over the last
   millennium, and tide gauge records for the recent period. A fundamental
   problem is to know the trend of the ASLR, possibly distinguishing
   between land subsidence and sea level components. Instrumental data go
   back to 1872 and a key point is to extend our knowledge back in time.
   Long-term ASLR has been investigated with the help of a biological
   indicator, the height of the green belt of the algae that live in the
   tidal range and whose upper front shows the average high tide level.
   Fortunately, in the first half of the 18. century, this indicator was
   accurately drawn by the famous painter Antonio Canaletto (1697-1768) and
   his pupils, mainly Bernardo Bellotto (1722-1780), in their photographic
   paintings made with an optical `camera obscura'. It has been possible to
   compare the tidal level, as it was in the 1700s and today. After careful
   spot investigation and minor corrections for some changes to the
   hydrological system occurred in the meantime, the bulk submersion of
   Venice estimated from the paintings is 61 +/- 11 cm with average yearly
   trend 1.9 mm y(-1)},

Abstract = {CO2 geological storage constitutes a relatively recent scientific
   technology which Could play a major role for the solution of global
   warming. More research is needed, however at the same time
   already-available scientific knowledge has scarcely been disseminated.
   Thus researchers who work in this area are faced with two main problems:
   1) get their work to be known and its relevance understood also outside
   research and academic circles 2) avoid possible misconceptions in the
   understanding of their research, which could result in negative
   reactions in public opinion and consequently to the refusal of
   geological storage. This contribution addresses the need to spread
   knowledge and make this technology better known for the exploitation of
   its potentialities. Methodological questions about effective
   dissemination are dealt with. A psycho-sociological approach is
   presented and discussed, focusing on: 1) how to develop in the public a
   positive attitude and interest for learning about geological storage;
   and 2) how to develop in the public a correct understanding of what
   geological storage is. This kind of approach works on both the cognitive
   and emotional levels, beginning with the scientists' 0 representations
   of their own work and followed by studying the interactions people can
   develop when coming in contact with a new topic, what kind of reactions
   are stimulated and how they can be understood depending on specific
   social contexts, etc. Language Study and image issues are explored with
   specific reference to geological research. Based oil Italian experiences
   for geological research dissemination the role Of Cultural contexts and
   psychosocial representations are illustrated. The importance of the
   analysis of emotional processes is explained. The role of information,
   communication, storage sites' image and social context in relation to
   stakeholders decisions is analysed. A possible proactive image strategy
   is outlined.},

Abstract = {In this work we have analyzed the entry behavior of all known types of
   meteoroids using a single-body end height model in order to test their
   entry penetration into the earth's middle and upper atmosphere. We have
   utilized a new physically based model that incorporates a number of new
   features including a total power budget during entry as well as the very
   important processes of ablation and deceleration. More specifically, we
   have examined the meteoroid sizes and masses that are capable of
   terminating their visible flight at the Mesopause. In order to
   accomplish these calculations, we have assigned specific shape, shape
   change, angle of entry, radius, velocity, the kinetic energy removal D
   parameter of ReVelle, bulk density (or equivalently formulated in terms
   of uniform volume-weighted porosity), etc. We have further tested the
   reliability and done a test calibration of the model predictions
   utilizing an extreme entry case (for a Leonid bolide that penetrated to
   the Mesopause on November 15, 2001 and that was detected by photometry
   as well as by using infrasound). Finally, after assuming specific
   velocity limits for each group with the specific size limits being
   predicted by the model, we have also compared our predicted mass influx
   results (number per year on Earth versus initial mass) against recent
   Large Aperture Radar data obtained at the Arecibo Observatory by Janches
   (personal communication, 2003). Generally, quite small meteors are
   ``stopped{''} at the Mesopause, but for the weakest materials, bodies as
   massive as similar to 0.14kg can be stopped above the Mesopause,
   especially at shallower entry angles. Generally reasonable agreement was
   found, but there are still a number of uncertainties as well.
   Eventually, this analysis should be redone using our advanced meteor
   modeling techniques including our triggered progressive fragmentation
   model, etc. ReVelle, 2001 a. Theoretical Leonid entry modeling, In:

Abstract = {Soils of high latitudes store approximately one-third of the global soil
   carbon pool. Decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) is expected to
   increase in response to global warming, which is most pronounced in
   northern latitudes. It is, however, unclear if microorganisms are able
   to utilize more stable, recalcitrant C pools, when labile soil carbon
   pools will be depleted due to increasing temperatures. Here we report on
   an incubation experiment with intact soil cores of a frost-boil tundra
   ecosystem at three different temperatures (2 degrees C, 12 degrees C and
   24 degrees C). In order to assess which fractions of the SOM are
   available for decomposition at various temperatures, we analyzed the
   isotopic signature of respired CO2 and of different SOM fractions. The
   delta C-13 values Of CO2 respired were negatively correlated with
   temperature, indicating the utilization of SOM fractions that were
   depleted in C-13 at higher temperatures. Chemical fractionation of SOM
   showed that the water-soluble fraction (presumably the most easily
   available substrates for microbial respiration) was most enriched in
   C-13, while the acid-insoluble pool (recalcitrant substrates) was most
   depleted in C-13. Our results therefore suggest that, at higher
   temperatures, recalcitrant compounds are preferentially respired by
   arctic microbes. When the isotopic signatures of respired CO2 of soils
   which had been incubated at 24 degrees C were measured at 12 degrees C,
   the delta C-13 values shifted to values found in soils incubated at 12
   degrees C, indicating the reversible use of more easily available
   substrates. Analysis of phospholipid fatty acid profiles showed
   significant differences in microbial community structure at various
   incubation temperatures indicating that microorganisms with preference
   for more recalcitrant compounds establish as temperatures increase. In
   summary our results demonstrate that a large portion of tundra SOM is
   potentially mineralizable. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {Public awareness of global environmental issues including global warming
   prevention has increased in recent times, as evidenced by the fact that
   over 130,000 houses have already installed photovoltaic power generation
   systems, and the number of people using such systems is increasing.
   The power conditioner is,an indispensable component of a photovoltaic
   power generation system. Recent advances in semiconductor technology
   have seen growing efforts to improve the efficiency and reduce the
   size/weight of power conditioners.
   On the other hand, power conditioners do have a serious problem: they
   generate electromagnetic noise.
   To make matters worse, the electromagnetic noise that is generated at
   power conversion is transmitted to the solar cells through electric
   wires, the solar cells serving as an antenna to radiate the
   electromagnetic noise.
   The radiated electromagnetic noise may cause operation and communication
   failures in other electronic equipment (1)
   Amid this, there has as of yet been no standardization of
   electromagnetic environment compatibility either by the International
   Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), or any other organization.
   We are hoping that a new EMC standard will be established, and believe
   it should cover photovoltaic power generation systems. To provide basic
   data for. the establishment of this new standard, we conducted
   measurement and analysis on EMC for a photovoltaic power generation
   system based on the IEC61000 Series the conventional EMC standard for
   electrical appliances.},

   seamless authentication and roaming in the new inter-working system
   between third-generation (3G) mobile networks and wireless local area

   handled together with global movements (macro-mobility). We introduce
   location as a key context in secure roaming mechanism for context-aware
   interworking. The fast secure roaming with location-aware authentication
   is implemented at an entity called LBS Broker that utilizes the concepts
   of direction of user and pre-warming zone. We present the interworking
   techniques with LBS Broker for seamless secure WLAN/3G integration
   enabling to meet the requirements of the future location-aware service
   scenarios. Performance evaluation is also presented to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed scheme for fast location-aware secure

Abstract = {Nitrogen (N) losses following land-applied animal wastes present an
   environmental and economical dilemma for producers. Gaseous N losses
   from pasture-land contribute to global warming, ozone depletion, acid
   rain, and inefficient plant N uptake. This study was designed to monitor
   nitrous oxide emissions following swine waste and commercial fertilizer
   treatments to bermudagrass (Cynedon dactylon {[}L.] pers) pastures.
   Denitrification rates were monitored on a biweekly basis for six 0.12-ha
   bermudagrass pastures for three consecutive growing seasons (1998-2000).
   Treatments consisted of three split applications of either swine
   effluent supplemented with ammonium nitrate (SW) or commercial
   fertilizer (CF). Peak denitrification rates were greatest in 1998,
   ranging from 0.6 to 1.7 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) for effluent-treated
   plots and 0.3-1.5 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) for commercially fertilized
   plots. Results from this study suggest denitrification is not a
   significant N loss pathway in swine waste-amended bermudagrass systems.},

Abstract = {Societal concerns on pollution, hazardous materials, global warming and
   sustainability provoke responses from society. Public policy or changes
   in consumer behavior are specific examples. For electrical and
   electronic equipment (EEE) the released EU directives such as the WEEE
   (Directive on Waste of Electrical and Electronic Equipment) and RoHS
   (Restriction of the use of certain Hazardous Substances in EEE) and
   future directives such as EuP (Ecodesign of energy-using Products) are
   already having and will have a significant impact on how products are
   designed, built, used and treated at their end of life.
   To bear this challenge, measurable and understandable criteria for
   assessing and demonstrating the environmental performance of products
   are needed. Key methodology for a holistic and reliable environmental
   evaluation of products is Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). This
   scientifically established approach leads to useful and reliable results
   regarding environmental evaluation of the entire life cycle of products.
   From the acquisition of raw materials, over the use of the products to
   the end of life management all life cycle stages are considered. Product
   characteristics (such as weight and materials used, energy consumption
   during use) and all relevant inputs and outputs (such as energy, raw
   materials, emissions) occurring throughout the entire life cycle are
   regarded.
   To improve products from an environmental point of view, ecodesign
   recommendations for product designers need to be reliable and easy to
   handle. Environmental performance indicators based on technical product
   characteristics and based on LCA permits to efficiently ameliorate the
   environmental profile of a product. Efficiently, since only a fraction
   of information input is needed, this approach provides a tailored and
   simplified method using environmental performance indicators. This paper
   introduces a consistent methodology for the development of environmental
   performance indicators for information and communication technologies
   (ICT) products.},

Abstract = {Halon 1301 (bromotrifluoromethane) is known as both an ozone-depleting
   and global-warming substance. In this study, a drying treatment was
   developed for halon 1301 decomposition. Burnt lime, burnt dolomite, and
   burnt brucite were used as reactants. Halon 1301 is decomposed to gases
   containing halogen, and these gases react with the reactants
   simultaneously. The effects of the treatment temperatures, the treatment
   times, and the reactant compositions on the effective treatment process
   were investigated. Bromine in halon was almost completely recovered with
   the reactants. However, the recovery of fluorine was low. Burnt dolomite
   and burnt brucite were better reactants than burnt lime. The presence of
   MgO in the reactants plays an important role in this process.},

Abstract = {Growing concerns over global warming due to the greenhouse effect from

   further improve the energy efficiency of its products. The display case
   refrigerator is a major supermarket appliance and its life expectancy
   could be as long as 10 years. In response to ever-more stringent
   regulations on energy efficiency, a prototype has been designed for
   minimizing energy use. Options such as insulation improvements using
   vacuum insulation panels (VIPs) and vacuum glazing (VG) were examined in
   a display case refrigerator by measuring heat loss. Results show that
   energy efficiency can be improved up to 30\% by simultaneously mounting
   the VG and VIPs on the display case refrigerator. Additionally, the
   frost or sweat was eliminated for the energy-efficient display case
   refrigerator.},

   reduced water supply from the Colorado River, and struggle with the
   devastating impacts to the Sierra Nevada snow pack caused by global
   warming. Yet is California preparing for this future today? Does the law
   direct land-use planners on the city and county levels to work in
   concert with their water planning counterparts to prepare for these
   significant challenges? As concern over these issues has grown, recent
   judicial and legislative action has added new substantive requirements
   for land-use and water planning, as well as adding procedural
   requirements that ask land use and water planners to communicate with
   one another more consistently. In addition, both the Governor's Office

   the conditions persist, death of the coral. Faced with the prospect of
   catastrophic coral mortality associated with global warming and related
   environmental shifts, researchers have focused their efforts on coral
   bleaching; although significant progress has been made in this area,
   understanding of the basic biology of these associations remains poor.
   Here we discuss several issues that have potentially contributed to this
   knowledge gap and conclude that without a sound understanding of the
   basic biology of these important symbioses, it will be very difficult to
   elucidate the mechanisms that drive coral bleaching.},

Abstract = {A global review of the stratigraphical and geographical distribution of
   Tyloplecta reveals that the genus ranges in age from Kungurian to
   Changhsingian (Middle to Late Permian). Tyloplecta first evolved in
   South China in the Kungurian (late Early Permian). The genus went
   through its first diversification in the Guadalupian, suffered a major
   extinction at the end of the Guadalupian, and re-diversified in the
   Wuchiapingian. T. yangtzeensis persisted into the Changhsingian as the
   only survivor of the genus involved in the end-Permian mass extinction.
   Palacogeographically, South China is not only the centre of origin for
   the genus but also an area of diversification and evolution. In addition
   to South China, Tyloplecta has also been recorded from the Far East
   Russia, Japan, central Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Qiangtang Terrane of
   Tibet, Salt Range, Iran, Armenia, Hungary Yugoslavia, and Slovenia. This
   geographic spread suggests that Tyloplecta was primarily restricted to
   the Palaeotethys and is indicative of warm-water palacoequatorial
   conditions. Its presence in some of the northeast Asian terranes (e.g.,
   parts of Japan and Far East Russia) and in the Salt Range (Pakistan) and
   central and north Iran (part of the Cimmerian microcontinents)
   demonstrate that the genus invaded the middle palacolatitudinal regions
   in both hemispheres during the late Middle Permian in response to
   increased shallow marine biotic communications between Cathaysia in the
   eastern Palaeotethys and southern Angaraland, and between Cathaysia and
   Peri-Gondwanaland. The invasion of Tyloplecta (and some other taxa) into
   the southern shore waters of Angaraland may be explained by assuming
   ocean surface current connections and close palaeogeographical
   proximities between the South China, Sino-Korea and Bureya blocks. In
   comparison, the invasion of Tyloplecta into the Peri-Gondwanaland region
   is more likely a result of reduced palaeogeographical distance between
   South China and Peri-Gondwanaland and the appearance of the Cimmerian
   microcontinents as migratory stepping stones.},

Abstract = {Infectious diseases represent a limiting factor for the further
   development of Italian aquaculture. The recent introduction and
   spreading of new pathogens, along with the global climatic change, has
   contributed to a considerable decrease in trout production. Emerging
   pathologies in rainbow trout culture include viral diseases, e.g.
   infectious haematopoietic necrosis (IHN), bacteria] diseases, such as
   lactococcosis and visceral flavobacteriosis, and parasitical diseases,
   e.g. proliferative kidney disease (PKD). Higher mortality rates in trout
   fry and fingerlings are generally induced by visceral flavobacteriosis
   and IHN, while the main losses in large trout during the warm season are
   due to lactococcosis and PKD. Mariculture has at present a better
   sanitary status compared to trout culture, but a rapid dissemination of
   pathogens, including zoonosis agents, is envisaged also for scabass and
   seabream. Emerging pathologies in sea bass include VNN,
   pseudotuberculosis, streptococcosis and tuberculosis. Seabream is much
   more resistant and is mainly affected by novel Vibrio infections and
   enteromyxidiosis. A good sanitary management of fish farms is essential
   for avoiding or limiting losses caused by emerging pathologies.
   Transmission of zoonosis agents to man, through the consumption of
   cultured fish, is very remote in Italy. On the contrary, transmission of
   Streptococcus iniae, Vibrio vulnificus and Mycobacterium marinum by
   means of improper manipulation of infected fish, could represent a
   potential hazard for fish farmers and fish processors, as well as for
   people preparing fish meals.},

Abstract = {Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-like films were formed by electron
   cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition
   (ECR-PECVD) employing the solid material evaporation technique where the
   PTFE was evaporated by a COZ laser resulting in the production of
   fluorocarbon species. This system does not employ any perfluorocompound
   (PFC) feed gases which cause global warming. In this system, it was
   found that C2F4 and higher species such as CxFy (x greater than or equal
   to 2) were generated by COZ laser evaporation. The films were analyzed
   by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared
   absorption spectroscopy (FT-IR). As a result, the chemical composition
   of films formed at microwave powers below 0.4 kW indicated a PTFE-like
   structure with an F/C ratio of 2.0 and a dielectric constant of 2.0.
   Densities of CFx (x = 1-3) radicals and F atoms in the ECR plasma
   employing the solid material evaporation technique were measured to
   understand the behavior of these radicals by infrared diode laser
   absorption spectroscopy (IRLAS) and actinometric optical spectroscopy
   (ROES), respectively. From these measurements, higher species of C2F4
   and CxFy were clarified to be the important precursors of PTFE-like
   fluorocarbon films.},

Abstract = {More than 900,000 hectares of eucalypt plantations have been established
   to date in China but these are concentrated in warmer coastal regions of
   southern provinces. Relatively small areas have been planted to date in
   cooler areas of south central China - areas where some eucalypt species
   can grow well. These cooler areas include much of China's `red soils
   region' which contains large tracts of eroded wasteland; land that is
   often suitable for forest plantation establishment.
   The mean growth of eucalypt species across sites in cooler areas of
   south central China is summarised. Performance of those species that
   have been included in trials at three or more sites for each of two
   distinct environments - the Yunnan Plateau and then lower elevation
   areas - is reported. The lower elevation sites are spread across Hunan,
   inland Fujian and northern Guangxi provinces. Eucalypts that have
   demonstrated the best potential on the Yunnan Plateau include E.
   globulus, E. maidenii, and E. smithii. In other south central provinces
   where the target sites are below 1,000 m elevation, E. dunnii, E.
   camaldulensis and, for milder sites, selected sources of E. grandis have
   shown good potential. E. nitens and a range of other cold tolerant
   eucalypt species warrant further testing and evaluation across the
   region, but only if this is well coordinated with good communication and
   collaboration among researchers and institutes.
   Significant genetic variation in cold tolerance has been demonstrated
   within some of the key eucalypts for south central China, providing
   opportunities to improve their adaptation for cooler sites. However, it
   emphasized that attention must also be focused on soil, nutritional and
   silvicultural management for eucalypt plantations to be successful in
   this region.},

Abstract = {IPCC third report says that we have still a lot of uncertainties to
   predict global warming even using latest GCMs. Regarding atmospheric
   radiation, uncertainty of the radiative forcing is still large, which is
   mainly caused by aerosols, clouds, and water vapor interacting among
   them.
   National Space Development Agency of JAPAN (NASDA) and Communications
   Research Laboratory (CRL) started Phase-A study with European Space
   Agency (ESA) in the EarthCARE project. The objectives of EarthCARE
   project are to observe vertical and horizontal distributions and
   physical characteristics of aerosols and clouds from a satellite, and
   also to measure the precise Earth radiation budget simultaneously.
   Finally we will be able to evaluate physical processes of clouds and
   aerosols regarding the radiative budget and forcing.
   The EarthCARE satellite carries 5 sensors, namely Cloud Profiling RADAR
   (CPR), Atmospheric LIDAR (ATLID), Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI), Broad
   Band Radiometer (BBR) and Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS). The
   result of the pre-Phase A study shows the synergy observation benefits
   using some compensative combinations of sensors, such as CPR / ATLID for
   clouds, ATLID / MSI for aerosols, BBR / FTS for the radiation budget.
   NASDA and CRL are studying FTS and CPR, respectively. CPR is a 94GHz
   RADAR using 2.5m diameter reflector with Doppler measurement mode. The
   sensitivity is -38dBZ. The vertical and horizontal resolution is 100 in,
   I kin, respectively. FTS is a Michelson interferometer of which spectral
   measurement range is from 5.7 mum to 25 mum with 0.5 cm(-1) unapodized
   spectral resolution. FOV is 10 km by 10 km.
   EarthCARE is planned to be launched in 2008 for 2 years mission. Phase-A
   study will continue. until the end of 2003.},

Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {128-139},
Abstract = {Globalisation is a key pressure affecting the current and future use of
   the rangelands of Australia. While primary producers often perceive an
   insatiable demand for food as a guarantee of business success, declining
   population growth rates and high levels of productivity improvement in
   world food production are reducing the importance of food and fibre from
   the rangelands. This, combined with significant changes in consumer
   demands, is driving rangeland producers to meet market specifications
   for quality, safety, animal welfare and sustainability.
   Sustainability is a particular challenge with the rangelands certain to
   be affected by global warming and the politics and strategies required
   to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Currently the rangelands produce a
   higher proportion of greenhouse gases compared with their contribution
   to the economy. However, they also provide an opportunity for carbon
   sequestration.
   While international trade liberalisation has been of advantage to the
   grazing industries in the rangelands, increased global awareness of the
   Australian rangelands, facilitated by the communications revolution, is
   encouraging alternative uses including tourism, existence value and
   other conservation and biodiversity management uses. The growing concept
   of multi-functionality will also impact on the rangelands as
   international government programs continue to encourage non-commercial,
   surplus production of food.
   These influences are forcing major changes in the way land is used and
   what it produces.},

Abstract = {Several small globular proteins exhibit a simple two-state folding
   process (sharp transition). The rather short folding times of proteins
   (fast folders) indicate that folding is guided through some sequence of
   contact bindings. We discuss the possibility for reconciling a two-state
   folding event with a sequential folding process, i.e. a folding pathway
   in a schematic model of protein folding. We show that both single and
   multiple folding pathways can lead to an apparent two-state folding from
   a thermodynamic point of view. We also discuss water interactions in
   protein folding, leading to cold and warm destabilization of the
   protein. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

Title = {Sandy shore ecosystems and the threats facing them: some predictions for
   the year 2025},

Abstract = {Pollution, mining, disruption of sand transport and tourism development
   widely affect sandy shores, and these systems may be subject to
   increased erosion in future, yet there have been few attempts to review
   them. The present review focuses largely on ocean sandy beaches,
   providing an introduction to much of the relevant literature, and
   predicting possible states of the system by 2025. Sandy shores are
   dynamic harsh environments, the action of waves and tides largely
   determining species diversity, biomass and community structure. There is
   an interchange of sand biological matter and other materials between
   dunes intertidal beaches and surf zones. Storms and associated erosion
   present the most substantial universal hazard to the fauna.
   Human-related perturbations vary from beach to beach; however,
   structures or activities that impede natural sand transport or alter the
   sand budget commonly lead to severe erosion, often of a permanent
   nature. Many beaches also suffer intermittent or chronic pollution, and
   direct human interference includes off-road vehicles, mining, trampling,
   bait collecting, beach cleaning and ecotourism. These interferences
   typically have a negative impact on the system. Identified long-term
   trends include chronic beach erosion, often largely due to natural
   causes, as well as increased ultraviolet (UV) radiation and changes
   related to global warming. It is not expected that predicted temperature
   changes will have dramatic effects on the world's beaches by 2025, but
   the expected rise in sea level, if coupled with an increase in the
   frequency and/or intensity of storms, as predicted for some regions, is
   likely to lead to escalating erosion and consequent loss of habitat. It
   is suggested that increased UV radiation is unlikely to have significant
   effects. Increases in coastal human populations and tourism, thus
   increasing pressure on the shore, while serious, may be largely offset
   in developed and developing countries by better management resulting
   from greater understanding of the factors governing sandy-shore systems
   and better communication with beach managers and developers. Beach
   nourishment is likely to become more widely practised. However, the
   continuing hardening of surfaces in and above the dunes is bound to be
   damaging. Human pressures in many underdeveloped countries show no signs
   of being mitigated by conservation measures; it is likely that their
   sandy shores will continue to deteriorate during the first quarter of
   this century. A long-term trend that cannot be ignored is the excessive
   amount of nitrogen entering the sea, particularly affecting beaches in
   estuaries and sheltered lagoons. The data presently available and the
   uncertainty of a number of predictions do riot permit of quantitative
   assessment or modelling of the state of the world's sandy shores by the
   year 2025, but some tentative, qualitative predictions are offered.},

Abstract = {URASHIMA was constructed in 2000 by JAMSTEC. Almost conventional AUVs
   have autonomous mode and simple acoustic control mode, but URASHIMA has
   three operation modes that are autonomous mode, acoustic control mode
   and UROV mode. In the autonomous mode, UMSHIMA cruises according to the
   preset schedule to collect the various data for global warming. In the
   acoustic control mode, it can transmit the image of TV camera with the
   very high performance acoustic communication device. Furthermore,
   URASHMA has one more operation mode called UROV mode. In UROV mode, the
   vehicle is connected to the mother ship with one fiber optic cable that
   diameter is about 1mm. When it cruises by UROV mode, the onboard
   operator can control it like ROV. Then the observation data and
   conditions of it can be watched in real-time through the optical
   communication system. UROV mode is used for debugging of the software,
   monitoring all equipment after launching and the real-time observation
   with various devices.
   UROV system was developed by JAMSTEC. This system was used to GENTATSU,
   UROV2000, UROV7K and BENKE1, which were all developed by JAMSTEC. These
   ROVs move almost vertical direction and they move short area for
   horizontal direction. But URASHIMA can move Aide area for horizontal
   direction by UROV mode.
   The sea trials have been carried out since 2000. Then the UROV mode is
   very useful for URASHIMA.
   The paper describes about UROV system and the optical communication
   system for URASHIMA.},

Abstract = {In this study, we examined the role of three social learning mechanisms
   in the development of undergraduates' depressogenic cognitive styles:
   modeling of parents' negative cognitive styles; negative inferential
   feedback from parents regarding the causes and consequences of stressful
   events in the child's life; and negative parenting practices. We
   obtained partial support for each of the three hypotheses. Compared to
   the parents of cognitively low-risk students, cognitively high-risk
   students' mothers exhibited more negative dysfunctional attitudes and
   inferential styles themselves; high-risk students' fathers showed less
   emotional acceptance and warmth; and high-risk students' mothers and
   fathers both communicated more stable, global attributional feedback and
   negative consequence feedback Sor stressful events in their children's
   lives. In addition, both parents' inferential feedback and fathers'
   emotional acceptance predicted their undergraduate children's likelihood
   of developing an episode of major or minor depression or the subtype of
   hopelessness depression during a 2.5-year prospective follow-up period,
   with some of these predictive associations mediated totally or in part
   by the students' cognitive vulnerability status.},

Abstract = {The present experiment examined the impact of fear on attitudes and the
   mediating role of information processing. Fear and argument strength
   were manipulated according to a 3 x 2 (Fear: Control vs. Moderate Fear
   vs. High Fear x Arguments: Weak vs. Strong) between subjects design.
   Fear was aroused with regard to the risks associated with global
   warming, and the information to be processed was a persuasive message
   about energy-conserving light bulbs. The results indicate that both
   moderate and high levels of fear had an impact on attitudes. Moderate
   fear resulted in more positive attitudes toward energy-saving bulbs, but
   only when strong arguments in favor of these bulbs were provided, High
   fear had a positive effect on attitudes, regardless of argument
   strength. It is concluded that fear may influence attitudes both in a
   direct and an indirect way, mediated by information processing. Whether
   the direct or the indirect effect dominates appears to depend on fear
   intensity.},

Abstract = {A LCA (life cycle assessment) scheme for any industrial activity system
   is introduced to estimate the quantitative loan on the environment with
   the aid of the NETS (numerical environment total standard) method
   proposed by the authors as a numerical measure. Two kinds of
   environmental loads respecting fossil fuel depletion as input resources
   to the system and global warming due to CO2 emission as output are taken
   into account in the present eco-criterion, in which the total eco-load
   (EcL) value is calculated from the summation of respective environmental
   load factors on the whole process in a life cycle of the system. This
   NETS method is applied to eco-management co-generation systems, in which
   a computer-aided output navigator proceeds the LCA estimation,with ICON
   and Q\&A communication. An operation scheme most friendly to the
   environment with a minimum EcL value, i.e., an eco-operation scheme, is
   derived from the optimization theory.},

Abstract = {A novel dry etching process for amorphous silicon (a-Si) and tungsten
   (W) for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) chamber cleaning has been
   performed by electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) O-2 plasma employing a
   solid-material evaporation system where fluorocarbon species are
   produced from fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) by CO2 laser
   evaporation for preventing global warming. This process enables us to
   realize etching of materials without using any perfluorocompound (PFC)
   feed gases which have a high global warming potential (GWP). Etching
   characteristics together with diagnostics of the F atom density, CFx (x
   = 1-3) radical densities, electron density and temperature have been
   investigated as functions of pressure. As a result, it was found that
   etching rates of a-Si and W films were determined based on the F atom
   density, ion flux and ion bombardment energy. Furthermore, etching rates
   of a-Si and W films increased by heating the fluorocarbon species before
   introducing them into the plasma reactor. Thus, high rates of etching of
   a-Si and W films were successfully achieved by this novel etching
   process compared with conventional etching using ECR plasma with CF4/O-2
   feed gases.},

Abstract = {Concern over contribution of nitrous oxide (N2O) to global warming and
   stratospheric ozone depletion has prompted measurement of nitrous oxide
   (N2O) emissions from agricultural soils and study of controlling
   factors. The objectives of this study were (1) to measure the magnitude
   of N2O emissions from application of (NH4)(2)SO4, Ca(NO3)(2) or urea
   teach at 100 kg N/ha) to a Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) stand,
   and (2) to compare flux of N2O from the surface measured with covers to
   N2O production and denitrification in soil cores collected at a depth of
   2.5 -7.5 cm. Water, NH4+ and NO3 contents of soil cores were also
   measured. Application of all three fertilizers increased N2O production
   by soil cores, and N2O flux from covers. The two measurements differed
   in temporal pattern and magnitude. Flux of N2O from the soil surface is
   a more complex and variable process than N2O production in a specific
   soil layer. The possibility of increased N2O production with urea
   requires further investigation under more controlled conditions.
   Nitrification of NH4+ appeared to be the principal source of N2O.},

Abstract = {Recent recommendations for environmentally sound use of liquid animal
   manure often include injection of slurry into soil. Two of the most
   important undesired side effects, ammonia (NH3) volatilisation and odour
   emissions, are usually significantly reduced by slurry injection. On the
   other hand, because of the higher amount of nitrogen (N) remaining in
   soil, the risk of nitrate (NO3-) leaching and nitrous oxide (N2O)
   emissions is increased. Thus, the reduction of local effects caused by
   NH3 deposition, e.g. N enrichment and soil acidification, may be at the
   cost of large-scale effects such as ozone depletion and global warming
   as a result of emitted N2O. In this context, nitrification inhibitors
   can contribute significantly to a reduction in NO3- leaching and N2O
   production.
   A field experiment was carried out at IGER, North Wyke, which aimed to
   evaluate the effect of the new nitrification inhibitor
   3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP/ENTEC (TM)). For this experiment,
   N-15 enriched dairy slurry was used and the isotopic label in soil N as
   well as in N2O were studied. After slurry injection into the grassland
   soil in August 2000, the major emissions of N2O occurred during the
   first ten days. As expected, high N2O emission rates and N-15 content of
   the emissions were concentrated on the slurry injection slots, showing a
   steep decrease towards the untreated centre-point between slurry
   injection slots. The nitrification inhibitor DMPP proved to be very
   efficient in reducing N2O emissions. At a rate of 2 kg DMPP ha(-1), the
   total amount of N2O emitted was reduced by 32\%, when compared with
   slurry injection without DMPP. The isotopic label of the emitted N2O
   showed that during the 22-day experimental period, emissions from the
   slurry N pool were strongly reduced by DMPP from 0.93 kg N2O-N ha(-1)
   (-DMPP) to 0.50 kg N2O-N ha(-1) (+DMPP), while only a minor effect on
   emissions from the soil N pool was observed (0.69 to 0.60 kg N2O-N
   ha(-1); -DMPP, +DMPP, respectively). Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {One of the often-overlooked aspects of today's modem electronic
   information spread is that not all people speak English. Since the
   software applications are mainly made for areas where they sell best,
   smaller and poorer nations with a local language and alphabet are often
   ignored and forgotten by the software industry. The situation today is
   that the people who do not speak English and would like to use their own
   language are somewhat deprived and as a result sometimes quite reluctant
   to start using electronic communication.
   This paper concerns itself with the sources, consequences and means to
   solve this problem. The issue is discussed in regard to real-life
   example of situations with the use of the Macedonian language and a
   comparative analysis of the solutions applied. The examples concentrate
   on Internet publishing using the Macedonian language and its effects and
   popularity among the Macedonian-speaking individuals.
   The paper provides an analysis of the current situation from which
   conclusions applicable to other cultures can be extracted.
   ``Welcome to our first global village. It is Macedonian because it is
   ours, and we are proud of it. It is global because it connects all of
   us, it brings us together to unity much more powerful than each of us.
   No matter what we are, or how much we have achieved in our lives, we are
   here together. To show our cultural heritage. To show what we know and
   what we have inherited from the past generations. However, we are here
   to learn too, to go forward and to leave much more for the generations
   to come. Still, we have to fill the gap left by the five hundred years
   slavery, humiliation and tyranny.
   In this small village you will find a bit of everything and a lot of
   warmth. It is well categorized and, although the communism ended, it is
   self-governed. Don't abuse it. Look at the richness it has.
   Don't leave quickly from our village. We are a hospitable nation. Have a
   chat with us or with those who have the same interests in the discussion
   groups.
   Even if you don't have much time, have a peek - they may brighten your
   day. Even if you have a business to do, there is something for you. Send
   faxes, paging and SMS messages, or call the World. Yes, we want to see
   you happy whatever you do.
   For our own good

Abstract = {The growing concerns over global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions
   have pushed the appliance industry to further improve energy efficiency
   of its products. Refrigerator-freezers (RF), as one of the major home
   appliances, consume about one-fifth of the electricity in a household,
   and its life expectancy could be as long as 10-15 years. In response to
   future stricter regulations, several design options were considered For
   improving the energy efficiency of a conventionally designed domestic
   RF. The options, such as insulation improvements obtained by using
   vacuum insulation panels (VIPs), energy saving defrost control, and
   high-efficiency compressors were examined in a prototype RF.
   The energy consumption of the original 1997 production
   refrigerator-freezer was selected as the baseline in order to compare
   the measured energy savings of each option and the combined options on
   the prototype refrigerator-freezer. This study has reached a goal to
   develop a prototype that has an energy consumption rate of 20\% less
   than the baseline model.},

Abstract = {This paper describes a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) of a new
   Business Communication 10 (BC 10) and an old Business Communication 8
   (BC 8) model of the private branch exchange Modular Digital 110 (MD
   110), designed and sold by Ericsson Enterprise AB (EE) and produced by
   Flextronics, in this case for the European Union (EU) market. LCA is a
   technique for assessing the environmental aspects and potential impact
   associated with a product's whole life cycle from the ``cradle to
   grave{''}. The study meets the requirements of the standards
   International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) 14040:1997 English
   (E), ISO 14041:1998 E and the draft standards ISO/Draft International
   Standard (DIS) 14042 and ISO/DIS 14043 and was critically reviewed by
   Henrik Wenzel, Instituttet for ProduktUdvikling (The Institute for
   Product Development, IPU) in Denmark. The modelling of the system
   includes manufacturing (hardware and EE's organisation), use stage
   (electricity consumption), end-of-life (recycling processes) and
   transports. Electronic devices axe modelled in depth (16 groups of
   components) and data from over 40 suppliers have been collected. EE's
   organisation (development, marketing \& sales, supply, installation,
   service and maintenance) is modelled for the use of offices and business
   travelling. The following main conclusions of the project are based on
   results for potential contributions to the environmental impact
   categories acidification, global warming and eutrophication, which were
   chosen to be the most relevant. The environmental impact improvements of
   the new model compared to the old are approximately 10\%, and the
   uncertainty of the results is judged to be smaller than the difference
   between the systems.
   The use stage and the manufacturing stage give the largest impacts, both
   for the new and the old model. In the manufacturing stage, the hardware
   production clearly dominates. EE's organisation is secondly most
   important and hardware transport is least important. This is due to more
   environmental load from service and business travelling in the
   organisation than environmental load arising from the distribution of
   the product. The results predominantly reflect energy use, whereas
   toxicological aspects could not be reliably assessed due to lack of data
   and reliable methods and needs separate attention. The technology
   improvements shown for BC 10 compared to BC 8 only describe design
   improvements made by EE, and do not take into account potential
   technology production improvements made by component suppliers.},

Abstract = {In this work, a combination of two hydrofluorocarbon compounds,
   pentafluoroethane (FC-125, C2HF5) and 1,1-difluoroethane (FC-152a,
   CF2H-CH3), was evaluated as a potential replacement for
   perfluorocompounds in dielectric etch applications. A high aspect ratio
   oxide via etch was used as the test vehicle for this study, which was
   conducted in a commercial inductively coupled high density plasma etch
   tool. Both process and emissions data were collected and compared to
   those provided by a process utilizing a standard perfluorinated etch
   chemistry (C2F6). Global warming (CF4, C2F6, CHF3) and hygroscopic gas
   (HF, SiF4) emissions were characterized using Fourier transform infrared
   (FTIR) spectroscopy. FC-125/FC-152a was found to produce significant
   reductions in global warming emissions, on the order of 68 to 76\%
   relative to the reference process. Although etch stopping, caused by a
   high degree of polymer deposition inside the etched features, was
   observed, process data otherwise appeared promising for an initial
   study, with good resist selectivity and etch rates being achieved.},

Abstract = {The Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL) will connect London's St. Pancras
   Station and the Channel Tunnel with a new, 109 kilometre, high speed
   railway. Its alignment to the east of London is across the Thames
   Marshes.
   The marshes are typical of low-lying areas now protected by tidal
   defences. Networks of natural and man-made rivers and ditches, which
   receive up-catchment flows and provide local drainage, cross the land
   and discharge via several tidal gates into the River Thames.
   Preliminary assessments identified that flooding through this area may
   seriously disrupt the rail service, with tunnel and track inundation,
   rail wash out and signal and communications failure, causing suspension
   of service for up to six months and over a hundred million pounds of
   damage.
   To assess the flooding risk to the CTRL, and to provide information on
   how its construction could affect river flows and levels, an in-depth
   assessment has been undertaken of the complex hydrological and hydraulic
   characteristics of the area. This has encompassed the appraisal of a
   variety of records, for a 30 square kilometre study area. Hydraulic
   modelling has highlighted railway flood defence requirements and has
   been used to assess proposed hydraulic mitigation and cross drainage
   designs.
   Conclusions have also been drawn from the study on how the overall
   hydraulic regime operates in low-lying areas protected from the tide.
   This is an increasingly important issue as the impacts of global warming
   may mean a rise in sea levels, and a change in climatic conditions
   causing more frequent flood events.},

Abstract = {This study examined organizational status, defined as power and
   influence within a company, and gender as predictors of nonverbal
   behavior between employees of the company (N = 46). Participants were
   videotaped while performing structured tasks in dyadic interactions with
   two different partners. Nonverbal behaviors conveyed by the face, body,
   and voice quality were measured in terms of global dimensions
   (dominance, expressiveness, and warmth) and discrete behaviors such as
   smiling, nodding gesturing gazing, and interrupting. Status and gender
   effects were examined both on a within-dyads and a between-individuals
   basis. Although a number of status and gender effects emerged, there was
   no overall support for Henley's hypothesis that differences in status
   can explain gender differences in nonverbal behavior. Indeed, gender and
   status differences did not parallel each other, and gender differences
   became more pronounced when status differences were controlled.},

Abstract = {This research explores public judgments about the threat-reducing
   potential of experts, individual behavior, and government spending. The
   data are responses of a national sample of 1225 to mail surveys that
   include measures of several dimensions of public judgments about violent
   crime, automobile accidents, hazardous chemical waste, air pollution,
   water pollution, global warming, AIDS, heart disease, and cancer.
   Beliefs about who can best mitigate threats are specific to classes of
   threats. In general, there is little faith that experts can do much
   about violent crime and automobile accidents, moderate faith in their
   ability to address problems of global warming, and greater expectations
   for expert solutions to the remaining threats. People judge individual
   behavior as effective in reducing the threats of violent crime, AIDS,
   heart disease, and automobile accidents but less so for the remaining
   threats. Faith in moire government spending is highest for AIDS and the
   other two health items, lowest for the trio of violent crime, automobile
   accidents, and global warming, and moderate for the remaining threats.
   For most threats, people are not distributed at the extremes in judging
   mitigators. Strong attitudinal and demographic cleavages are also
   lacking, although some interesting relationships occur. This relative
   lack of sharp cleavages and the generally moderate opinion indicate
   ample opportunity for public education and risk communication.},

   African American dyads, of whom 64 (70\%) fell below the poverty line.
   Ratings of warmth, sensitivity, responsiveness, encouragement of
   initiative, stimulation, and elaborativeness during a semistructured
   play interaction were correlated with measures of global cognition,
   expressive and receptive communication, and communication use. The
   overall quality of the home environment and maternal ratings of
   stimulation and elaborativeness were the most consistent correlates of
   infant communication measures. Relationships were stronger in
   middle-income than lower-income dyads. These results support the linkage
   of didactic and Functional aspects of maternal behavior to cognitive and

Abstract = {Hemopexin is a plasma protein with exceptionally high affinity for heme,
   During liver transplantation heme is released via lysis of transfused
   blood. This heme may catalyze peroxidative reactions that contribute to
   ``reperfusion{''} injury of the organ, Using a rat liver model of cold
   storage and reperfusion we tested the potential anti-oxidant effects of
   hemopexin, After 3 h of cold storage rat liver was reperfused with warm
   oxygenated buffer. Spontaneous liver chemiluminescence, which is a
   parameter of oxyradical production, was measured during reperfusion and
   expressed as an index of free radical production (IFRP),
   Chemiluminescence reached a maximum within 5 min of reperfusion and
   decreased to baseline within 30 min. Addition of hemopexin to the
   perfusate (5 mu M) significantly decreased the IFRP, By contrast, the
   control proteins albumin and gamma-globulin (10 mu M) had a smaller
   non-significant effect. The data suggest that heme could be complexed by
   hemopexin during reperfusion, thus inhibiting heme mediated cellular
   injury. (C) 1998 Academic Press.},

Abstract = {There have recently been calls in the UK for the development of a
   `Richter scale for risk'. It is helpful when considering the merits of
   these proposals to distinguish three categories of risk: directly
   perceptible risk, e.g. climbing a tree, riding a bicycle; risks
   perceptible with the help of science, e.g, cholera and other infectious
   diseases; and virtual risks, about which scientists do not know or can
   not agree, e,g. BSE/CJD and suspected carcinogens. The professional
   management of directly perceptible risks is made difficult and
   frustrating by people insisting on being their own risk managers, and
   overriding the judgements of risk experts and the interventions of
   safety regulators. Risks perceived through science are framed in terms
   of probabilities. The Richter scale for risk seeks, by means of a table
   of `benchmark risks', to help scientists communicate their knowledge of
   risk to the lay public. But frequently these probabilities are nothing
   but confident sounding expressions of uncertainty. We do not respond
   blankly to uncertainty; we impose meanings upon it, and act upon these
   meanings. Virtual risks may or may not be imaginary - but they hare real
   consequences. The diverse responses to the inconclusive scientific
   evidence about issues such as BSE;, pesticide residues, low level
   radiation, and global warming indicate that virtual risks are perceived
   through different cultural filters. The incoherent and inconclusive
   debates about such issues suggest the need for a better understanding of
   these fillers.},

   prediction. To observe 3-dimentional profile of cloud, the
   millimeter-wave multi-parameter airborne cloud profiling radar
   (Nickname: SPIDER) has been developed by Communications Research
   Laboratory (CRL). SPIDER was designed to use for not only airborne but
   also ground-based. The frequency of the radar was decided W-band (95GHz)
   to have enough sensitivity for cloud particles. The multi-parameter
   function can be used to identify cloud particles. Antenna scanning
   mechanism is useful to observe 3-dimentional profiles of cloud.
   In January 1998, the first experiment to observe clouds was performed in
   Japan with SPIDER. Then preliminary results will be shown.},

Abstract = {The relative impact of land evaporation-atmosphere coupling and SST
   forcing on the Asian monsoon-Southern Oscillation system is examined
   from a series of GCM experiments. It is found that the interannual
   variability of the coupled Asian monsoon-Southern Oscillation (AM-SO)
   system is controlled mainly by anomalous SST forcing. Consistent with
   previous studies, strong (weak) Asian monsoon is associated with the
   cold (warm) phase of ENSO. SST anomalies allow anomalies in the AM to be
   communicated globally, while seasonally fixed SST limits the influence
   of the anomalous RM to the northern hemisphere and Eurasia. We also
   found that the interannual variability of the AM-SO system that can be
   attributed to land-atmosphere coupling is relatively small.
   Strong asymmetries with respect to the annual cycle are found in the
   mean behavior of the AM-SO system with the SO responding rapidly to the
   annual cycle forcing in late boreal winter/early spring, while the AM
   signal remains almost unchanged. During late boreal spring to early
   summer, the AM activity picks up suddenly, while the SO remains
   relatively unchanged. The above behavior suggests a ``capacitor{''}
   effect with a slow build-up and a vapid discharge of energy via the SO
   and the AM during different seasons. This behavior appears to be
   inherent in the atmosphere-land coupled system forced by climatological
   SST. While the effect of land-evaporation interaction appears to be
   smalt an the large scale coupled AM-SO system, ifs regional influence is
   significant Over East Asia, land surface evaporation-atmosphere
   interaction is responsible for the excitation of a see-saw oscillation
   in precipitation over land and the adjacent ocean. The polarity of this
   oscillation appears to be chaotic, being dependent on the large scale
   circulation forced by SST anomalies and the seasonal cycle, with the
   transition being phase-locked to the late spring/early summer period.},

Abstract = {Objective. Surveys demonstrate somewhat consistent gender differences in
   environmental concern, but there is no consensus on reasons for these
   differences. This research makes the case that differences in perceived
   vulnerability to risk explain the gender gap found in environmental
   surveys and other, quite distinct, areas of potential risk as well.
   Methods. Two national surveys, administered simultaneously and each
   involving very different environmental risks (hazardous waste sites and
   global warming), are analyzed in terms of gender differences. Results.
   In both surveys, in every question that involves reactions to a specific
   risk, women are more concerned than men. Standard deviations also are
   consistently smaller for women. When health-risk perceptions enter
   equations accounting for environmental concerns, however, the gender gap
   disappears. Conclusions. Questionnaire items that imply specific risks
   tend to produce significant gender differences. These types of survey
   results can be construed as communication events in which respondents
   who feel vulnerable answer in ways that urge caution on policymakers.},

Abstract = {Observations of O-3, CH4, and N2O from the Halogen Occultation
   Experiment (HALOE), the Cryogenic Limb Array Etalon Spectrometer
   (CLAES), and the Microwave Limb Sounder on the Upper Atmosphere Research
   Satellite are compared with fields calculated using a three-dimensional
   global chemistry and transport model which uses winds from a data
   assimilation system. Model and observations are found to be in generally
   good agreement for ozone at middle latitudes between 50 and 3 hPa. Much
   of the horizontal structure in the observed long-lived tracers N2O and
   CH4 is seen in the model, but the model profile shapes differ
   systematically from those seen by CLAES (N2O and CH4) and HALOE (CH4).
   To understand the influence of transport on these comparisons, attention
   is focused on January and February 1992, when a series of minor warmings
   impact the ozone and tracer distributions. The model O-3 at 6.8 hPa,
   which agrees well with observations, is shown to be influenced by
   transport from the tropics toward middle and high latitudes, which
   increases O-3, and photochemical processes, through which O-3 is
   destroyed. However, the model N2O and CH4 mixing ratios at middle
   latitudes at 6.8 hPa are much greater than observations. Good
   comparisons between modeled and observed O-3 and poor comparisons
   between modeled and observed N2O and CH4 are explained by differences in
   the horizontal transport from the subtropics. Here photochemical
   processes control the O-3 mixing ratio, and the horizontal winds
   transport air with realistic ozone mixing ratios to the middle
   latitudes. For the longer-lived gases, the model mixing ratios in the
   subtropics far exceed observations, and the horizontal winds transport
   air with higher than observed mixing ratios to middle latitudes, leading
   to the poor comparisons. This analysis shows that the photochemical-and
   transport processes that affect O-3 at middle latitudes during winter
   are well represented in the model. However, for long-lived tracers,
   errors in the model subtropics are communicated to middle latitudes by
   the horizontal winds.},

   This research requires one to correctly determine the sound speed from

   primarily based on the equation for the speed of sound determined by Del

   detail using the deep submergence vehicle, `'SHINKAI 6500,'' from the
   Japan Marine Science and Technology Center (JAMSTEC). From our

Abstract = {Recently, ocean acoustic tomography (OAT) has been used to investigate
   the phenomenon of global warming and in wide-area oceanic observations.
   OAT can determine the sound-speed profile from measured acoustic travel
   times over known ray paths. The seawater temperature profile and the
   existence of ocean currents can be estimated using the sound-speed
   profile. However, the measured arrival time structure contains many
   pulses with different paths. Ray geometry fundamentals (i.e., numbers of
   turning points of rays, initial angle, etc.) must be properly
   identified. The sound-speed structure varies with observation area
   (i.e., west Mediterranean Sea, low-, mid-latitude sea area, etc.) and
   season. It has been shown by the Japan Marine Science and Technology
   Center (JAMSTEC) that a special ocean structure with sound speed
   increasing linearly with depth is formed in the west Mediterranean Sea.
   We have to understand the characteristics of sound propagation for each
   sea area in advance. In this paper, the characteristics of sound
   propagation for an ocean model for areas such as the west Mediterranean
   Sea have been analyzed in the time domain using Stickler's normal mode
   method (SNM). The effects of acoustic bandwidth (ABW) on the pattern of
   arrivals have been examined.},

Abstract = {Metropolitan transportation and land development patterns in most of the
   world are growing increasingly unsustainable. Many factors point to the
   need for adoption of a new paradigm for sustainable transportation and
   community development in both high and low income countries:
   overpopulation, growing air pollution, limited physical and economic
   capacity to expand automobile-based transportation systems without
   community destruction, growing inequality in the distribution of
   resources, and the urgent need to limit global CO2 emissions to slow the
   pace of global warming. This paper discusses the new paradigm for
   integrated and sustainable transport strategies.
   A paradigm shift is underway in transportation and community
   development, analogous to the shift underway in the electric utility
   sector since the 1970s. There is growing recognition that environmental
   and economic sustainability suffer from market-distorting subsidies and
   public policies which favor the most resource-intensive means of
   transport. The reductionist, supply-side oriented strategies of the past
   are beginning to be replaced by more holistic approaches that integrate
   demand-side and supply-side system management with full-cost pricing.
   Much can be learned by comparing patterns of transport and land
   development in different countries, noting key factors which have led to
   dramatic differences in travel demand, mode shares, energy use, and
   efficiency of resource use to meet social and economic requirements.
   Emerging information and communications systems technologies will help
   enable fundamental reforms in integrated transport system management
   (including systems for automated road and parking pricing and automated
   vehicle speed limitation) to encourage market-based substitution of high
   resource efficiency communication and transport modes in place of
   resource-intensive industrial age transport modes.
   Technology innovation will improve the compatibility of motor vehicles
   with environmental protection and sustainable development, but must be
   complemented by and harnessed to strategies to manage travel demand. To
   promote sustainable development in transport we should: (1) preserve and
   protect modal diversity, just as we protect bio-diversity, recognizing
   that different modes are needed to most efficiently serve different
   travel markets with their varying requirements for distance, speed, and
   payload; (2) understand the underlying activity basis of travel demand
   and travel choices and use this to explore opportunities for developing
   long-term least-cost strategies for shaping both travel demand and
   supply characteristics; (3) explicate the total internal and external
   long-term costs of transportation choices and move towards fuller cost
   pricing of transport, removing hidden subsidies, pricing distortions,
   and incentive/disincentive structures which prevent fair competition
   between modes and reduce modal diversity and overall community and
   transport system efficiency and equity; (4) promote institutional and
   pricing system reforms to ensure better integration and coordination of
   policies for long-term least-cost community development harmonizing
   transportation policy with land use, communications, tax policy and

Abstract = {There is now a considerable body of literature on the techniques
   available for modeling and communicating error in spatial databases.
   Some error models have solid statistical foundations, while the basis
   for others is nor so strong. In this paper, three basic approaches to
   the problem are examined. The application investigated is a fundamental
   one-to determine the position of a given terrain elevation value and to
   portray the resultant error of the answer. Such a problem can be of
   critical concern to communities in cases of flood plain mapping,
   determination of rising sea levels resulting from global warming, or
   delineation of the full supply level for a proposed reservoir. In this
   instance, the authors suggest that the application of simple probability
   theory, when combined with the error estimates supplied by data
   producers and current computer graphics capabilities, can provide users
   with more meaningful information concerning the error of their spatial
   database products. In turn, this information may allow them to better
   deal with an issue of growing concern.},

Abstract = {In investigation into the phenomenon of global warming, ocean acoustic
   tomography (OAT) has been used for analysis. In this analysis method,
   the most important factor is exact calculation of the sound speed in
   water, that is, the sound wave propagation time. However, so far,
   analysis of SOFAR propagations in the low-latitude sea area has been
   lacking. Such a sea area is very important for analysis of the El Ni-(\$
   over bar n)o Current and others, although a special sound speed
   structure appears in the region of uniform sound speed formed around the
   SOFAR axis. For SOFAR propagation, we have compared time-domain results
   using two models, based on the measurement of far-range sound wave
   propagation in the sea east of Mindanao Island. The models chosen for
   the analysis are Stickler's normal mode method (SNM) and ray
   approximations. (The SNM time series is obtained via Fourier synthesis.)
   By this means we examined the characteristics of wave theory and ray
   theory in the low-latitude sea area.},

Abstract = {Focus groups were conducted with physicians, pharmacists and patients
   prior to semistructured interviews with physicians and patients. The
   survey was conducted in Spain, Germany and the UK. There were high
   levels of awareness of environmental issues, with ozone layer damage and
   global warming being of particular concern. Most respondents were aware
   of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) use in aerosols and in refrigerators.
   However, their presence in asthma metered dose inhalers (MDIs) was much
   less widely known. German physicians had the highest awareness (78\%)
   while only 1 in 10 of UK patients was aware. Patients expressed concern
   on learning that they inhale CFCs. Reaction to the concept of a non-CFC
   propellant was universally favourable, though sometimes qualified with
   the need for adequate safety and efficacy data. Patients expected to be
   informed of the change by doctors, pharmacists or patient information
   leaflets. Physicians expected to receive information as soon as possible
   but did not want patients informed until launch. Manufacturers and
   representatives would be the primary information sources for physicians.
   Pack changes should be minimised. Communicating th change to non-CFC
   propellants to physicians, pharmacists and patients is all important.},

Abstract = {The climatic variables that were most useful in classifying the
   infection status of Queensland cattle herds with bluetongue virus were
   assessed using stepwise linear discriminant analysis. A discriminant
   function that included average annual rainfall and average daily maximum
   temperature was found to correctly classify 82.6\% of uninfected herds
   and 72.4\% of infected herds. Overall, the infection status of 74.1\% of
   herds was correctly classified. The spatial distribution of infected
   herds was found to parallel that of the suspected vector, Culicoides
   brevitarsis. This evidence supports the role of this arthropod species
   as a vector of bluetongue viruses in Queensland.
   The effect of potential changes in temperature and rainfall (the
   so-called `global warming' scenario) on the distribution of bluetongue
   virus infection of cattle herds in Queensland was then investigated.
   With an increase in both rainfall and temperature, the area of endemic
   bluetongue virus infection was predicted to extend a further 150 km
   inland in southern Queensland. The implications of this for
   sheep-raising in Queensland are discussed.},

Abstract = {Burning of fossil fuels globally helps put 3 billion metric tons of
   carbon into the atmosphere per year more than is removed by all carbon
   sinks. By far the best use of that carbon would be to arrange sufficient
   extra plant growth and then transfer that plant growth into new stable
   soil organic matter. Twenty or more years of such effort would immensely
   improve the soils of the world. Any fraction of it would help decrease
   the threat of global greenhouse warming. A great worldwide goal should
   be to increase levels of soil organic matter levels considerably. It
   should be possible. The most important research relating to soil organic
   matter is perhaps yet to be done. Elucidation of the regulators involved
   in the build-up and decomposition processes of various types of soil
   organic matter deserves high priority. It should be possible to develop
   technologies where the regulators can be managed and controlled for the
   beneficial purpose of increasing levels of soil organic matter. The role
   of calcium in stabilizing soil organic matter needs more study. Genetic
   engineering of specific microorganisms may be needed to increase levels
   of soil organic matter.},

Abstract = {The practice of pediatrics is unique among medical specialties in many
   ways, among which is the nearly certain presence of a parent when health
   care services are provided for the patient. Regardless of whether
   parents or other family members are physically present, their influence
   is pervasive. Families are the most central and enduring influence in
   children's lives. Parents are also central in pediatric care. The health
   and well- being of children are inextricably linked to their parents'
   physical, emotional and social health, social circumstances, and child-
   rearing practices. The rising incidence of behavior problems among
   children attests to some families' inability to cope with the increasing
   stresses they are experiencing and their need for assistance. When a
   family's distress finds its voice in a child's symptoms, pediatricians
   are often parents' first source for help.
   There is enormous diversity among families - diversity in the
   composition of families, in their ethnic and racial heritage, in their
   religious and spiritual orientation, in how they communicate, in the
   time they spend together, in their commitment to individual family
   members, in their connections to their community, in their experiences,
   and in their ability to adapt to stress. Within families, individuals
   are different from one another as well. Pediatricians are especially
   sensitive to differences among children - in their temperaments and
   personalities, in their innate and learned abilities, and in how they
   view themselves and respond to the world around them. It is remarkable
   and a testament to the effort of parents and to the resilience of
   children that most families function well and most children succeed in
   life.
   Family life in the United States has been subjected to extensive
   scrutiny and frequent commentary, yet even when those activities have
   been informed by research, they tend to be influenced by personal
   experience within families and by individual and cultural beliefs about
   how society and family life ought to be. The process of formulating
   recommendations for pediatric practice, public policy, professional
   education, and research requires reaching consensus on some core values
   and principles about family life and family functioning as they affect
   children, knowing that some philosophic disagreements will remain
   unresolved. The growing multicultural character of the country will
   likely heighten awareness of our diversity.
   Many characteristics of families have changed during the past 3 to 5
   decades. Families without children younger than 18 years have increased
   substantially, and they are now the majority. The average age at
   marriage has increased, and a greater proportion of births is occurring
   to women older than 30 years. Between 1970 and 2000, the proportion of
   children in 2- parent families decreased from 85\% to 69\%, and more
   than one quarter ( 26\%) of all children live with a single parent,
   usually their mother. Most of this change reflects a dramatic increase
   in the rate of births to unmarried women that went from 5.3\% in 1960 to
   33.2\% in 2000. Another factor in this change is a slowly decreasing but
   still high divorce rate that is roughly double what it was in the mid-
   1950s.
   Family income is strongly related to children's health, and the
   financial resources that families have available are closely tied to
   changes in family structure. Family income in real dollars has trended
   up for many decades, but the benefits have not been shared equally. For
   example, the median income of families with married parents has
   increased by 146\% since 1970, but female- headed households have
   experienced a growth of 131\%. More striking is that in 2000, the median
   income of female-headed households was only 47\% of that of
   married-couple families and only 65\% of that of families with 2 married
   parents in which the wife was not employed. Not surprising, the
   proportion of children who live in poverty is approximately 5 times
   greater for female-headed families than for married- couple families.
   The composition of children's families and the time parents have for
   their children affect child rearing. Consequent to the increase in
   female- headed households, rising economic and personal need, and
   increased opportunities for women, the proportion of mothers who are in
   the workforce has climbed steadily over the past several decades.
   Currently, approximately two thirds of all mothers with children younger
   than 18 years are employed. Most families with young children depend on
   child care, and most child care is not of good quality. Reliance on
   child care involves longer days for children and families, the stress
   imposed by schedules and created by transitions, exposure to infections,
   and considerable cost. An increasing number and proportion of parents
   are also devoting time previously available to their children to the
   care of their own parents. The so- called `` sandwich generation{''} of
   parents is being pulled in multiple directions. The amount and use of
   family time also has changed with a lengthening workday, including the
   amount of commuting time necessary to travel between work and home, and
   with the intrusion of television and computers into family life. In
   public opinion polls, most parents report that they believe it is more
   difficult to be a parent now than it used to be; people seem to feel
   more isolated, social and media pressures on and enticements of their
   children seem greater, and the world seems to be a more dangerous place.
   Social and public policy has not kept up with these changes, leaving
   families stretched for time and stressed to cope and meet their
   responsibilities. What can and what should pediatrics do to help
   families raise healthy and well- adjusted children? How can individual
   pediatricians better support families?
   Family Pediatrics
   The American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP) Board of Directors appointed
   the Task Force on the Family to help guide the development of public
   policy and recommend how to assist pediatricians to promote well-
   functioning families ( see Appendix). The magnitude of the assigned work
   required task force members to learn a great deal from research and
   researchers in the fields of social and behavioral sciences. A review of
   some critical literature was completed by a consultant to the task force
   and accompanies this report. That review identified a convergence of
   pediatrics and research on families by other disciplines. The task force
   found that a great deal is known about family functioning and family
   circumstances that affect children. With this knowledge, it is possible
   to provide pediatric care in a way that promotes successful families and
   good outcomes for children. The task force refers to that type of care
   as `` family- oriented care{''} or `` family pediatrics{''} and strongly
   endorses policies and practices that promote the adoption of this 2-
   generational approach as a hallmark of pediatrics.
   During the past decade, family advocates have successfully promoted
   family- centered care, `` the philosophies, principles and practices
   that put the family at the heart or center of services; the family as
   the driving force.{''} Most pediatricians report that they involve
   families in the decision making regarding the health care of their child
   and make an effort to understand the needs of the family as well as the
   child. Family pediatrics, like family- centered care, requires an
   active, productive partnership between the pediatrician and the family.
   But family pediatrics extends the responsibilities of the pediatrician
   to include screening, assessment, and referral of parents for physical,
   emotional, or social problems or health risk behaviors that can
   adversely affect the health and emotional or social well- being of their
   child.
   Family Context of Child Health
   The power and importance of families to children arises out of the
   extended duration for which children are dependent on adults to meet
   their basic needs. Children's needs for which only a family can provide
   include social support, socialization, and coping and life skills. Their
   self- esteem grows from being cared for, loved, and valued and feeling
   that they are part of a social unit that shares values, communicates
   openly, and provides companionship. Families transmit and interpret
   values to their children and often serve as children's connection to the
   larger world, especially during the early years of life. Although
   schools provide formal education, families teach children how to get
   along in the world.
   Often, efforts to discuss families and make recommendations regarding
   practice or policy stumble over disagreements about the definition of a
   family. The task force recognized the diversity of families and chose
   not to operate from the position of a fixed definition. Rather, the task
   force, which was to address pediatrics, decided to frame its
   deliberations and recommendations around the functions of families and
   how various aspects of the family context influence child rearing and
   child health.
   One model of family functioning that implicitly guided the task force is
   the family stress model ( Fig 1). Stress of various sorts ( eg,
   financial or health problems, lack of social support, unhappiness at
   work, unfortunate life events) can cause parents emotional distress and
   cause couples conflict and difficulty with their relationship. These
   responses to stress then disrupt parenting and the interactions between
   parent and child and can lead to short- term or lasting poor outcomes.
   The earlier these events transpire and the longer that the disruption
   lasts, the worse the outcomes for children. The task force favors
   efforts to encourage and support marriage yet recognizes that every
   family constellation can produce good outcomes for children and that
   none is certain to yield bad ones. Unequivocally, children do best when
   they are living with 2 mutually committed and loving parents who respect
   and support one another, who have adequate social and financial
   resources, and who are actively engaged in the upbringing of their
   children.
   Conclusions
   From its discussions with family experts, its review of research
   literature, and its own intensive discussions, the task force was able
   to draw about the American family a limited number of conclusions that
   are relevant to pediatrics. Two overriding conclusions were apparent.
   First, children's outcomes - their physical and emotional health and
   their cognitive and social functioning - are strongly influenced by how
   well their families function. Second, there is much that practicing
   pediatricians can do to help nurture and support families and, thus,
   promote optimal family functioning and children's outcomes.
   Other conclusions were organized into 4 categories: 1) family function
   and structure, 2) family circumstances, 3) pediatric practice, and 4)
   policy. Within the first category, there are conclusions about the
   effect of family structure, values, beliefs, roles, and relationships on
   child rearing and child outcomes. The second category, family
   circumstances, summarizes information on the emotional climate within
   and outside the home that can promote or impede children's healthy
   development. Third, to provide appropriate care for children,
   pediatricians must expand their practices to encompass the assessment of
   family relationships, health, and behaviors. They must have the skills
   and comfort to inquire and learn about individual families, address
   family issues realistically, and link families to support groups and
   community resources. Pediatricians' ability to practice family
   pediatrics is influenced by training, personal experience and
   orientation, the work environment, and professional relationships.
   Finally, there is a need to develop policies that support reimbursement
   of pediatricians for services for families; that acknowledge the
   importance of marriage, parenting, and families for children; and that
   set clear expectations for parents while providing opportunities for
   them to obtain desired support.
   Recommendations
   The task force intended that its recommendations follow logically from
   the conclusions it was able to draw. The scope of family issues that
   were reviewed and discussed was very wide; consequently, in some cases,
   the conclusions are broad and the associated recommendations are
   numerous. The 80 recommendations also were organized into 4 categories
   to facilitate their consideration by individual physicians and various
   bodies within the pediatric profession. The first category, education,
   offers suggestions on family content for resident training and for
   continuing education for practitioners. It also contains some guidance
   on priority topics that should be addressed by parent education
   materials published by the AAP.
   The second category, policy and advocacy, suggests public policy
   positions that would support families and promote good child outcomes.
   It also addresses reimbursement policies, including diagnostic and
   procedure coding, which could enable pediatricians to practice family
   pediatrics. Some suggestions for internal AAP policies that would
   highlight the importance of a family orientation for the organization
   also are provided. Finally, opportunities are identified for the AAP to
   promote local and national policies and activities that support and
   strengthen families through its chapters and its relationships with
   other professional organizations.
   The third and most extensive category comprises recommendations about
   pediatric practice. This category includes suggestions for how
   pediatricians can modify their practice behaviors to promote good family
   functioning and effective parenting. Included are recommendations for
   how pediatricians can help strengthen parental partnerships in different
   family types, screen for family circumstances that put children at risk,
   and help create family- friendly practice environments. For additional
   guidance, some characteristics of a family- friendly pediatrician are
   listed in the final table of the report.
   The final category makes recommendations for research that the AAP
   should encourage or undertake to better enable pediatricians to provide
   family- oriented care. Areas for research include the mechanics,
   content, and effectiveness of family- oriented pediatrics practice;
   public policies and programs that promote family functioning and family-
   oriented care; and progress toward adopting the principles and content
   of family pediatrics among health care organizations, insurers, and AAP
   members.
   Taken as a whole, the recommendations provide a comprehensive plan for
   the AAP and pediatricians to assist families to function well and meet
   the needs of their children. The scope of work that is required is
   extensive and touches on nearly every aspect of the work done by the
   organization. It also requires modifications in pediatric practices to
   accommodate changes in the characteristics and circumstances of families
   that are served.
   Next Steps to Ensure Implementation
   The task force report is only the first step in what needs to be an
   ongoing process to ensure that children's health care is effectively
   provided in the context of their families. Attention to families should
   become integrated into the work of the AAP. This report should be
   reviewed and discussed by AAP staff, committees, sections, and members
   to determine which recommendations apply to their work and to plan
   strategies for their implementation. A single entity needs to take
   ongoing responsibility for monitoring and promoting activities related
   to the task force's recommendations. These responsibilities should be
   assigned with high priority to a standing committee of the AAP.},

   THE ASVA GROUP IN ESTONIA},

Abstract = {Bronze Age research in the eastern Baltic was actually initiated with
   the very first archaeological settlement excavations at Asva and Iru in
   Estonia and KlarAukalns in Latvia in the 1930s. Before the discovery of
   these hill fort sites the material culture remains were so minimal that
   researchers even expressed doubt concerning the existence of a proper
   Bronze Age or any remarkable settlement activity in this region. The
   quantity and quality of finds from these hill forts resulted in
   completely new insights into a fairly unknown cultural past of the
   eastern Baltic region. Quite soon the Estonian prehistorian Harry Moora
   reached the conclusion that the cultural life in the Early Metal Ages
   was against all expectations a very active and developed one, and
   vividly benefitting from intercultural contacts. Interestingly, Moora
   also stated that the rich archaeological material from these newly
   discovered sites indicated that the scarceness of grave and hoard finds
   (containing metals) need not necessarily correspond to the social and
   cultural reality of the past and that local deposition processes and
   customs should be considered. Consequently, there was no reason to
   believe that eastern Baltic societies suffered metal-poor or low-level
   economic conditions and cultural developments (see Chapter 1).
   Unfortunately, this was just a promising start of Bronze Age research
   that, as the entire methodology and working practice in eastern Baltic
   archaeology, could not be developed further. This was mainly due to the
   political conditions and circumstances throughout the post-World War II
   period and the times of the Iron Curtain. After the continuation of
   excavations at Asva on the Island of Saaremaa in the late 1940s and
   mid-1960s and other archaeological campaigns in the newly discovered
   site of Ridala (with palisade structures; excavated 1961-1963) in
   western Estonia preliminary results only and a few minor articles have
   been published. In his dissertation in 1970 Vello Laugas gave a detailed
   overview of the current state of research into the Bronze and Early Iron
   Ages in Estonia, also introducing the main results from earlier and his
   own archaeological investigations at Asva (years 1965-1966). The
   comprehensive account of facts leading to his chronological system and
   periodisation, particularly his interpretation and discussion of
   socio-economic processes and developments, were all grounded on
   archaeological objects, types and groups from Bronze Ages settlement
   sites. Because of remaining unpublished and the general isolation of
   Estonian archaeology in Soviet time Lougas' work could never be received
   or reviewed by any international research platform. The Bronze Age
   research of other Baltic Sea regions was simply denied access to the
   archaeological progress of the Baltic countries, also during the next
   decades. Laugas had a sort of autonomous position in the field of Bronze
   and Iron Age research in the Soviet republic of Estonia. Being
   practically the only academic authority specialising in and permitted to
   study and investigate the heritage from these prehistoric time periods,
   he also had to cover a large scope of other duties in salvation and
   heritage management. Accordingly, there was not much room and spirit
   left for theoretically reflective research, not to mention the danger of
   being steadily confronted with political ideological doctrines in Soviet
   archaeology and history sciences. When reflecting his (not always fully
   reproducible) applied methods in archaeological work and the missing
   data and documentations of significant archaeological sites and
   contexts, this background of political and economic circumstances needs
   to be reconsidered (Chapter 6). This concerns in particular the
   meteorite crater area of Kaali on Saaremaa and the archaeological
   excavations and the reporting under his direction (in 1976-1979), which
   have left some confusion and many open questions behind.
   In the late 1980s Valter Lang initiated a proper landscape and
   settlement archaeology in Estonia with emphasis on palaeogeography and
   palaeoecology, mainly in the course of studies and fieldworks in coastal
   areas of north Estonia (including Iru hill fort). His micro-regional and
   diachronic perspective on the dynamics in the interplay of humans and
   the environment in this region and on the introduction and development
   of agriculture also used to consider multidisciplinary studies of grave
   monuments and funerary customs. The research into stone cist graves as
   sources of osteoarchaeology and forensic research also helped to
   formulate new subject matters of social archaeology. Thus, compared to
   the Island of Saaremaa primarily represented by settlements in the
   period of study, the north Estonian research area offered a completely
   different but very convenient situation for developing new theories and
   models explaining these social and economic processes that are of
   significance for studies of the Asva settlement phenomenon. The
   archaeological evidence of land use for animal husbandry and field
   cultivation made researchers aware of socio-political implications of
   both the territorial organisation including land ownership and the
   technological systems behind agriculture. The emergence of a stratified
   agrarian society with control and ownership over the fertile lands
   (limestone rendzinas) and the population growth at the end of the Bronze
   Age as witnessed by the stone cist graves inferred to a drastically
   increasing social competition. According to Lang's studies, this
   eventually resulted in more diverse and complex relationships in society
   and between settlements during the Late Bronze Age. Asva and Iru, for
   instance, are now perceived as central places and integral in a
   functionalist perception of a system of interdependent open (single
   farms) and enclosed (complex) settlements. It is the exclusive
   occurrence of bronze casting workshops in settlements of hill fort type,
   a general eastern Baltic phenomenon, that makes the metalwork production
   perceived as a subject of social power-and-control institutions over
   supply and trade of metal (and the technology). With{''}the Late Bronze
   Age and the metalwork activity in the eastern Baltic the social and
   economic processes mentioned are viewed in close interaction and
   connection with the Nordic Bronze Age cultural sphere, with regions such
   as eastern Sweden and Gotland of southern Scandinavia. These processes,
   with Asva as a key site, are now viewed from a macro-historical center
   periphery perspective, situated in a Bronze Age world-system framework
   (Chapters 3 and 4).
   The recent studies performed by Lembi LOugas, Heidi Luik und Liina
   Maldre produced large amounts of new data and information on breeding
   strategies, the exploitation of animals and consumption patterns as well
   as on different social and technological aspects of craft production.
   Thus, the current Bronze Age research considers the Asva-type sites as
   key phenomena in the socio-economic developments in eastern Baltic's
   prehistory. This study is about completing the material culture studies
   and comparative analyses initiated by the aforementioned researchers
   (Lang et al.). In the course of the study, the archaeological groups of
   metalworking ceramics (moulds) and pottery emerged as illustrious
   `materialised' sources of the social life and the economic activities,
   which allowed contributing to the discussion of the dynamics in the
   cultural development throughout the Bronze Age in the eastern Baltic
   region.
   It was the topic of metalwork production and the archaeological evidence
   in the Estonian Bronze Age settlement sites that offered great potential
   for developing and discussing the much debated problems of Bronze Age
   research (Chapter 7). This is first of all due to the peculiar and
   paradoxical scarcity of archaeologically recorded metal finds in the
   Bronze Age eastern Baltic, particularly in Estonia. This metal-scarce
   situation has traditionally been viewed in research from a metal-centred
   perspective and that of the metal-rich Nordic Bronze Age culture in
   southern Scandinavia, with countless bronze depositions in graves and
   hoards as obvious manifestations of social and religious acts. In the
   eastern Baltic only the Late Bronze Age saw a slight increase in
   archaeological finds related to metalwork, but hoards and graves
   containing bronzes remained seldom. Settlement sites of hill fort type
   emerged at that time, with about 25 of them revealing evidence of local
   bronze casting production. Since their discovery there has been no doubt
   about the adoption and utilisation of metalworking technology in this
   region; however, its impact on society and economy has been perceived
   fairly differently in research. While emphasis has generally been put on
   the social significance behind the introduction and the organisation of
   metalworking production (with socio-political implications of power and
   control), the technology aspect has been either neglected,
   underestimated or any advancements and skilled practice in bronze
   casting have been regarded as minimal However, in a kind of axiomatic
   way, and always ruled by the applied Nordic perspective, there has been
   a sort of pessimistic ('metal poor') view of the entire eastern region,
   namely that Bronze Age societies suffered from sporadic and poor metal
   supplies. In turn, the eastern Baltic has been perceived either as an
   economically retarded region or as socio-politically and culturally
   dependent on the Nordic Bronze Age sphere.
   This is where the ordering and analysing of the archaeological metalwork
   remains of the Estonian Bronze Age sites led to critically question this
   paradigmatic approach of overemphasising the socio-economic significance
   of metals in the study area. This also concerned the neglection of
   culturally regionally different depositional customs possibly distorting
   our image of past realities and bronze circulation. In any case, the
   study of a production place such as Asva leaves no doubt that metals
   were imported, processed and distributed (and utilised) in regular and
   fairly large amounts. It also became clear that the current state of
   research (and knowledge) does not allow yet drawing hasty conclusions
   about the level of technological and skilled practices in eastern Baltic
   metalwork. This also concerns the relationship between the bronzeworker
   and his environment and raises questions such as how cultural, social or
   religious aspects of the Bronze Age life might have affected any choices
   and selection of materials and resources in metal production. Thus, the
   material culture studies performed actually provide us with the insights
   necessary to assess the social significance and function of bronzes in
   past societies. Technological innovations as results of intercultural
   contact are another research issue that emerged from this
   material-immanent analysis and that is in need of being developed
   further.
   Part of Chapter 7 is dedicated to the question concerning the striking
   preference of casting rings (ingots?) in the eastern Baltic production
   places and in neighbouring regions. Because the dominance of ring-shaped
   clay moulds is highly visible in the casting debris it is assumed that
   these ring moulds might reflect an intended standardisation and
   commoditisation in the production and distribution of bronzes. It is
   furthermore assumed that the bronze rings served as multi-functional
   semiproducts that were commoditized valuables facilitating the exchange
   of agricultural products and livestock. However, as ring ingots they
   were of particular use and value for the metalworker, i.e. the person
   who was able to distinguish different material qualities in the
   processes of technical complexity such as alloying and melting that
   implied the manipulation of the metal's properties (malleability,
   colour, hardness, etc.). The ring object allowed easy fragmentation,
   division and portioning for the crucible melt, it simply fulfilled the
   requirements in the production process and in the distribution and
   exchange In practicing ring casting the settlements of Asva type seem
   indeed to represent a stage in the metallurgy cycle of re-melting and
   converting scrap bronzes and primary metals to `ingots' in accordance
   with the custom and usage in the interregional metal exchange. The
   actual amounts of objects produced, the intensity and duration of bronze
   casting as well as the applied skill and expertise in metalwork
   technology are subject matters of further material studies.
   It has been acknowledged that in view of the economic foundations
   required for the import, exchange and production of metals, bronzework
   indeed points to a privileged or even elitist social craft activity, but
   not necessarily with the postulated implications of social power and
   control. In view of the social organisation of bronze casting the
   settlements of Asva and Ridala are remarkable examples of how production
   activities (not only metalwork) were subject to several social and
   economic units (households) within the settlement areas. In accordance
   with the various, apparently simultaneously existing production places,
   it appears that the major part of the community was actively involved in
   the complex and consuming processes of bronze casting (e.g. fabrication
   of moulds). It seems likely that there existed a multi-tiered
   organisation between the contributing craft persons, those with advanced
   skills and technological practice able to handle the demanding and
   complex melting and casting conditions such as air supply, heating
   procedure, determination of the melting point, etc. However, in
   consequence the social pattern behind metalwork craft in the Asva milieu
   appears to have been sort of `democratised' and bronze casting still a
   matter of seasonally practised community specialisation. Asva is indeed
   a key site in the Bronze Age context (and beyond) when it comes to
   discussions of the social meaning of craft specialisation in theory and
   archaeological praxis, particularly because of many indications of
   standardisation in style, design and technique of objects, semi-products
   and implements related to craft and production. This concerns not only
   the finds related to metalwork production but also those of the bone and
   antler industry in the Asva milieu (see also Chapter 11).
   The Asva pottery makes up another big subject matter in the analysis of
   the archaeological settlement material (Chapter 8), where several
   morphological, technical and functional utilitarian criteria create a
   picture of the emergence of various coarse and fine ceramic ware and
   pottery types. The burnished and profiled bowls, some with handles, are
   distinctive of the Asva-type ceramics and enrich the range of eastern
   Baltic pottery groups. They also speak of an advanced technology of
   ceramic processing. Remarkably, the external influences highly visible
   in the bowls and their manufacture, design and use seem to have only
   affected the pottery that represents the sphere of eating and drinking
   customs, which quantitatively makes up only a minor part in the
   Asva-type pottery. The jars, food containers and/or cooking pots as the
   most numerous and homogeneous group (coarse ware pottery) are way less
   advanced in design and stylistic individuality, and also the creative
   effort invested in their manufacture seems somewhat restricted. The
   coarse ware pots, discernible by the shape of the neck and rim parts and
   particularly by the applied techniques of surface treatment (smoothed,
   striated or textile imprints) seem to be modest in terms of quality
   (ware, temper), but apparently sufficient for their usage. The coarse
   pots, constantly decorated with horizontal rows of pits pressed in neck
   or shoulder parts of the vessels, display a tradition of the Bronze an
   Early Iron Age pottery of the northeastern European forest zone and
   appear to have been resistant to any innovations or implementation of
   stylistic features. This speaks in favour of a behaviour in style and
   technique following strict conventions and rules, all manifesting a
   local pottery tradition where the jars were allowed only very restricted
   concessions to outside influences (rusticated surfaces, knobs, cordon
   applications).
   As it is likely that the fine as well as the coarse ware pottery in the
   settlements of Asva type was locally produced, presumably by both native
   potters and new arrivals in the community, the causes of this dichotomy
   have been discussed. First, it has been assumed that the fine ware
   bowls, showing distinct traits of a central European Urnfield culture
   milieu, that of the Late Bronze Age Lusatian tradition, might signify or
   express aspects of both personal use and social identity behind these
   dishes. The specific use of the Asva-type bowls and their possible
   (ritual?) contexts of utilisation have also been discussed, but it
   remains a subject matter to be cleared with further chemical analysis of
   organic residues (e.g. lipids). However, the dichotomy and exclusive
   application and combination of decorative elements (pit stamps or
   striation on jars and imprints of twisted bronze rings and burnish on
   bowls) were rooted in a cultural traditional disposition. These rules
   and conventions in regard to style and technique of ceramic work and
   function were perceived and communicated in the given Bronze Age
   society, and therefore keenly respected by the potters. That is why it
   has been assumed that both the persistence and the openness for
   innovation or implementation of foreign elements highly visible in these
   two ceramic groups of the Asva-type sites are the results of a
   collective and dualistic habitus, a phenomenon that has been described
   in socio-anthropological literature. Accordingly, the coarse pots and
   large bowls could be understood as complementary representatives of two
   realms: that of the inner, the domestic, and that of the outer, the
   public. The jars as multi-purpose vessels used for storage and
   preparation of food on the one hand, and the hanging and the cup-like
   bowls used to prepare and serve special liquids or ingredients on the
   other, seem to represent different spheres of closed and private
   household activities against `exclusive' table and drinking manners (as
   open and communicative acts).
   Furthermore, the interconnection and coexistence of old and new elements
   in style and technique of the Asva-type pottery illustrate not only the
   integration of the coastal regions of western Estonia in a large
   interregional contact network, but also the complex ways and mechanisms
   in the transmission and diffusion of cultural stimuli and innovations
   eventually manifested in local ceramic groups (or style/culture
   provinces). The foreign characteristics and features on the bowls in the
   Asva pottery seem to be distributed in diverse and eclectic ways, with
   stylistic influences deriving from various geographical regions such as
   western and central Poland, southern and eastern Sweden and Gotland. In
   sum, these different, rather sporadic and changing directions of
   cultural influences and contacts give the Asva-type bowls an odd
   impression of a creolisation in style and technique. Their exclusive
   occurrence in the Estonian Late Bronze Age sites (Asva, Ridala, Kaali
   and Iru) only, while missing in Latvian and Lithuanian hill forts, and
   their sudden disappearance from the record with the decline of this very
   settlement type make them appear as evidence and symbols of social
   gestures.
   In the final conclusion the changes in society, economy and settlement
   in eastern Baltic Bronze Age have been discussed opposing the theories
   of the current re earch with the author's own material culture studies
   (Chapter 13). Places such as Asva, occurring in the Late Bronze Age on
   the archaeological map, do not only represent a new settlement type of
   permanent stationarity and centrality. Characteristic is the agrarian
   and maritime-based subsistence economy, complemented by various branches
   of secondary product processing and exclusive crafts (e.g. metalworking
   production). It has been asked whether the archaeologically studied
   settlements and the various production activities correspond to the
   postulates of sociopolitical relations determined by power and control
   based primarily on agriculture and metalwork. The Island of Saaremaa
   seems to reveal a slightly different, complex picture in comparison with
   hill forts of the eastern Baltic mainland: with Asva and complementary
   all-season activities, with hunting and fishing practices not only
   widening the range of subsistence practices. Particularly seal hunting
   and seasonality give reason to reassess the society relations and the
   settlement organisation behind this complex subsistence and craft
   production pattern. Both seasonality (i.e. climate and environmental
   aspects) and community specialisation (seal hunting strategies) need to
   be considered when applying theoretical concepts of hierarchisation and
   multi-tiered social organisation to the eastern Baltic Bronze Age
   cultural milieu, that is when implying chiefdom-like structures, elites
   or craft professionals.
   In dealing with the causes and factors of the societal change an attempt
   at an alternative explaination of the emergence of the Asva-type
   settlements against the neglected background of the role of seal hunting
   in Bronze Age settlement economy has been made. Accordingly, the
   maritime character of the studied sites on Saaremaa has been viewed from
   the perspective of seal exploitation as one of most eminent (marine)
   resources. The large percentage of seal bones among the rich
   osteological find material is undoubtedly a clear indicator of the
   extensive use and exploitation of seal products (blubber, leather). In
   any case, the subsistence of the Asva and Ridala hill forts was
   apparently not based on mixed farming and processing of secondary
   agrarian products alone like in the hill forts of the mainland. It seems
   also likely that seal populations and hunting grounds in southeastern
   Saaremaa (and the Gulf of Riga) have determined the location selection
   of the Bronze Age sites, particularly in a geographical landscape with
   limited, rather sporadic distribution of fertile soils (alvar or loo)
   for field cultivation and grazing cattle. Furthermore it has been
   hypothesised that settlements such as Asva and Ridala might have emerged
   from the fusion of conglomeratic, regionally dispersed single farms or
   households that might have constituted seasonal hunting sites. The
   merging and culmination of various economic and crafting activities and
   skills, the sort of communal and `democratised' participation in
   exclusive crafts such as metalwork plus the versatile interregional
   cultural contacts and influences visible in the material culture are
   aspects and phenomena that could be understand from the perspective of
   community specialisation. Thus, the marine `subsistence and the seasonal
   hunting trips to far regions in the Baltic following coastal routes
   could be the main determinant of the changing development in society and
   economy of Bronze Age Saaremaa. Not only the form of settlement
   organisation and the nature and complexity of social relations in
   community but also the character and the practice of a maritime
   settlement economy of Asva and its participation in the communication
   network of the Bronze Age Baltic Sea appear in a new light.
   This study provides a presentation, order and analysis of archaeological
   findings and contexts that are treated as representative, `materialised'
   sources of social and economic activities and that are considered as
   significant for the understanding of the major cultural processes taking
   place in the local settlement milieu throughout the Late Bronze Age.
   With this material immanent approach applied to archaeological remains
   of an outstanding quality and informative value and in connection with
   current and forthcoming insights from archaeozoological and -botanical
   research we possibly will be able to reconstruct the basic conditions,
   actions and choices of Bronze Age communities when adapting to their
   environment. This all leads to discussing the possible causes and
   factors behind these societal changes primarily visible in the
   archaeological settlement milieu. However, in regard to the social
   patterns behind settlement economy and craft as well as the territorial
   use and perception of the surrounding landscape, many questions on the
   entire Estonian Bronze Age settlement phenomenon still remain to be
   answered.
   In any case, the Asva site has the potential of taking a key position in
   future Bronze Age research. The reason is the quality and spectrum of
   the archaeological material and the data and information available.
   Considering the excellent conditions of preservation of bone material,
   for instance, the current interdisciplinary methods of research provide
   a large set of applications and solutions in approaching the
   above-mentioned problems and subject matters of research. Some of the
   formulated questions and hypotheses in connection with the Bronze Age
   technologies and economic strategies are already subjects of current or
   applied research projects involving various archaeological
   subdisciplines (e.g. materials science, experiments, archaeobiology) and
   building up international research platforms. As the ongoing
   archaeological excavations at Asva (since 2012), in collaboration with
   Valter Lang and Lembi Lougas, reveal, a new stage of Bronze Age research
   in Estonia has already begun.},

Abstract = {But he's a human being, and a terrible thing is happening to him. So
   attention must be paid. He's not to be allowed to fall into his grave
   like an old dog. Attention, attention must be finally paid to such a
   person. Arthur Miller Work in the fields of bioethics and public health
   ethics over several decades has been theoretically diverse, but
   particular styles of theorizing, let alone individual theories, do have
   distinctive philosophical assumptions and discursive characteristics.
   For example, in the domain of clinical bioethics a strong emphasis has
   been given to respect for autonomous will-formation by individuals in
   medical decisions and behavioral choices directly affecting them. In the
   domain of public health ethics and policy bioethics, where debates over
   issues such as health access and financing and over mandatory
   vaccination policies are ongoing, there is a clash between an
   individualistic understanding of rights, liberty, and privacy, on the
   one hand, and a communitarian understanding of the common good and the
   health and well-being of society as a whole, on the other. Cutting
   across this spectrum of individualism and holism, there is another
   discernable array of approaches to theorizing and concept formation in
   bioethics. Two in particular are pertinent to this article. One may be
   called an `applied' mode of bioethics, which is focused on applying
   moral principles and rules to specific situations of action and choice.
   A contrasting `relational' mode of bioethics seeks to present normative
   interpretations of historically embedded patterns of agency,
   interdependency, and institutional structures of power. To be sure, many
   specific works of bioethics utilize both an applied and a relational
   approach, but I believe that this distinction is heuristically useful.
   It can alert us to the fact that seemingly univocal concepts, such as
   autonomy, justice, equality, dignity, and personhood, carry a different
   meaning when they are theorized as principles to be applied from when
   they are theorized as practices to be interpreted. In this article my
   aim is to advance the discussion of relational approaches within
   bioethics by an interpretive analysis of the concept of solidarity and
   the concept of care when seen as modes of moral and political practice.
   I single out solidarity for this discussion because the range of moral
   questions traditionally associated with the concept are normatively
   integral to many key issues with which health policy and public health
   must deal-such as just access to healthcare, civic and financial support
   for social insurance and social welfare policies, and the
   intergenerational justice issues that bedevil the transition to an aging
   society and the mitigation of global climate change. In bioethics and
   public health ethics today, solidarity should be taken seriously and not
   dismissed as an obsolete idea from a bygone political era, and a recent
   surge of interest in the concept attests to this. On the other hand,
   care is an extremely influential normative concept in bioethics and has
   been for several decades. But the praxis and institutional support for
   care, no less than those of solidarity, are vulnerable in the current
   ideological climate and need to be supported discursively and
   politically. The practices of care are also essential to the core
   problems with which health policy and public health must grapple.
   I believe that solidarity and care offer instructive constitutive
   contexts within which the moral identity of persons is grounded and
   articulated in recognition, affirming the moral standing of those
   oppressed as equal members of a moral community, and in attention,
   attesting to the moral presence and considerability of those vulnerable
   and in need. Solidarity constitutes just affirmation of the other as
   subject, not merely object; care constitutes just attention to the other
   in a cognate way as subject, not object. This recognition of, and
   attention paid to, persons as moral subjects, in turn, can politically
   motivate a society in three respects. The recognition of solidarity and
   the attention of care can prompt progressive change toward a democratic
   willingness: (a) to provide for equal respect for rights and dignity;
   (b) to provide the social resources and services needed for just health
   and well-being; and (c) to focus its creativity and wealth on the
   actualization of potential flourishing of each and all. As Carol Gould
   observes concerning solidarity on this score: `the proliferation of
   solidarity relations that establish commonalities across differences,
   along with the linkages that develop among individuals and groups within
   solidarity movements, help to construct more universalistic conceptions
   of our obligations to each other.' Though much has been written on the
   protean concepts of solidarity and care, much still remains to be seen
   and said, for their ethical meaning and political significance change as
   they develop and manifest themselves in action over time. My discussion
   explores how persons and groups are recognized within the practices of
   solidarity and care; what stance or posture persons and groups take
   toward one another; and how their standing as free and equal members of
   a moral community is constituted and sustained by these practices. The
   guiding thread is right recognition of the full ethical standing of
   other human beings as subjects rather than as objects. Just recognition
   of moral standing and moral attention in solidarity and care is my
   explicit focus, finding the moral imagination and political will to
   sustain them, my background theme. Relational bioethics is a
   conceptually dynamic and rather eclectic field today, frequently drawing
   on paradigm-shifting work in moral and political philosophy and on
   conceptual innovations ongoing in the humanities and the social
   sciences, including feminist theories, critical theories of various
   kinds, and orientations informed by philosophical pragmatism and
   hermeneutics, among others. Inspired by several cognate modes of
   critical discourse, relational theorizing has turned away from both
   methodological and ethical individualism. Often, it is more concerned
   with diachronic (streaming over time) social practices than with
   synchronic (snapshot in time) individual acts. It favors what Margaret
   Urban Walker has called the `expressive-collaborative' model of morality
   over the `theoretical-juridical' model. It strives to place the agency
   of individuals within a constitutive context of meaning and
   interdependence. This context includes both dyadic and small group
   transactions among persons in direct contact and social, structural
   interdependencies growing out of institutionalized forms of power.
   Relational theorizing is a space of historical and cultural embeddedness
   and embodied living in the natural, material world.
   Moreover, due to this contextual perspective, relational theorizing and
   its discourse are reflexive in questioning their own philosophical
   grounding and epistemic legitimacy, and they are willing to move away
   from once solid convictions concerning objectivity, impartiality, and
   rational authority. All theory and praxis, on this view-including
   bioethics-inevitably reflects some positional perspective, especially
   when it most strenuously claims not to, and the best that can be done is
   to sustain a continuing engagement with different values and viewpoints
   over time. Closure of conflicting interpretations in the public space of
   question and answer is apt to be provisional and contingent. While
   chastening, this need not be an epistemological loss. Within such a
   critical reflexivity, possibilities open up for new ways of thinking
   about the basic object of study of ethics and for an emphasis on
   substantive aspects of ethical agency and value that have been
   relatively neglected heretofore. The object of study in bioethics (or in
   ethics generally) or in social science is not intuitively given or
   logically or methodologically determined. Settling on what should be
   taken as the unit of ethics analysis is the result of an on-going,
   contested process of interpretation, partly derived from available
   theoretical concepts, partly from the exercise of experience-based
   practical judgment. As social theorist Craig Calhoun argues, concerning
   this contest, we should `see the process as basic and never ending, and
   {[}subject] it to our continuing attention, rather than {[}imagine] that
   it is settled once and for all'. When bioethics focuses on relational
   practices, its designated object of study becomes those patterns and
   structures of interrelated activity, choice, and the exercise of power
   in time. These patterns are understood dynamically, as well as
   diachronically, with emergent properties and functions taking shape
   contingently rather than deterministically. Dynamic patterns in social
   life and human action may at times be spontaneous or random. However,
   when these patterns endure they comprise `practices', which may be
   defined as rule-based, value-laden forms of agency and activity in which
   diverse human capabilities or potentialities are actualized in the
   social and material worlds. Let us consider the elements of this
   definition more fully. First, social practices are structured
   sociologically by roles and relationships involving authority, power,
   distribution, and exchange. Governments, corporations, and hospitals are
   examples of institutionalized structures where social practices of
   various kinds take place. Social practices are also structured
   normatively by various conceptions of rightness, goodness, and value.
   Finally, social practices are experienced within lifeworlds of
   social-cultural meanings, where action-guiding reasons and motivations
   are formed, culturally mediated self- and group-identities are shaped,
   and ongoing reinterpretation of roles and relationships takes place. How
   are social practices so conceived possible and sustainable? Here the
   theoretical mediation between individualistic and communitarian
   orientations takes place. Diachronic social practices are made possible
   by moral agents who possess the ability to interpretively apprehend what
   other human beings are thinking in and through their agency, and to read
   the meaning such expressive agency conveys among agents as they interact
   together.
   A moral philosophy that took human beings to be radically solipsistic
   and opaque to one another would be unable to account for, let alone
   justify, its own discourse. A theory of practices presupposes the
   possibility of social communication and cultural hermeneutics. A
   practice is a form of activity that is valued in a society and governed
   by ethical norms. By engaging in these orderly, yet living, flexible
   activities, individuals pursue the attainment of excellence and seek to
   actualize potential capabilities. In this way, cultures and societies
   provide pathways for the development of flourishing lives well lived. It
   is through practices that virtues of character are developed, rights are
   respected and duties fulfilled, and beneficial collective consequences
   are pursued and obtained. To be sure, practices are conceptually
   constructed or `theorized', as are notions like autonomous reason, but
   they are grounded in ongoing cultural traditions and experimental or
   innovative new modes of social cooperation. Practices are both embodied
   and enacted. In the embodiment of practices, they are informed by tacit
   knowing or habitus-Pierre Bourdieu stresses their phenomenological and
   pre-reflective aspects. In the enactment of practices, evaluative
   deliberations take place and reflective judgments are arrived at that
   shape future activity and the structure of subsequent lives-Alasdair
   MacIntyre stresses their aspects that mirror Aristotle's notion of
   phronesis or practical judgment. Drawing explicitly on the work of
   Simone Weil and implicitly on Emmanuel Levinas, David Wiggins
   suggestively and rather effusively locates solidarity at `the root of
   the ethical'. His essay can be read as a strong reinterpretation of the
   object of ethical analysis or the moral point of view. He is not
   interested in offering a stipulative definition of solidarity or a
   classification of its various types. Solidarity names a fundamental
   awareness, arbitrary and uncalculating, and an ability to respond to a
   call to ethical action in the presence of another in peril-another who
   is a moral subject, a being with a visage, a gaze, an ontological claim
   to stake, a political inheritance to claim, a place of membership
   rightfully to occupy. In tune with considerations of this sort, I posit
   right recognition and attention at the center of my analysis of
   solidarity and care as moral practices. My approach is a modification of
   what has been called `interpretive phenomenology' and has been well
   developed in the literature of nursing and nursing ethics. While it is
   clearly well designed for the study of care, I believe it can also throw
   important light on solidarity. Like philosophical phenomenology more
   broadly, interpretive phenomenology seeks to offer a deeper
   understanding of intentional activity and its aim than agents themselves
   may explicitly possess; an understanding that may be more perspicacious
   than their own sense of what they are doing or bringing about. The
   following characterization of the general approach by Patricia Benner
   informs my discussion of solidarity and care: The understanding sought
   in interpretive phenomenology considers historical change,
   transformations, gains, losses, temporality, and context horizontal
   ellipsis The ethos embedded in {[}interpretive] phenomenology is respect
   for the social and cultural nature of being human. Human practices,
   skills, habits, meanings, and, in particular, recognition practices
   allow for the other to be encountered and made visible.
   When unarticulated, taken-for-granted practices and meanings fade from
   our social ecology and the social fabric of our lives, and we lose what
   they enable us to see, create, and represent. As I seek to develop it,
   this interpretive approach involves seeing human beings and doings in
   and through relationships of recognition, mutuality, respect and
   concern, need and vulnerability. In this relational dynamic, the
   watchword is the variety, not uniformity, of transactional agency and
   interdependent positions and projects. The context for the importance of
   right recognition and attention in solidarity and care is pluralism,
   reflexive perspectivalism, and a restructuring of economic and social
   institutions that would open society to new forms of inclusive,
   discursive engagement. Solidarity promotes these conditions and values
   as a future demand and promise; care honors them as a precondition for
   the possibility of the healing and meaning it facilitates. Perhaps I can
   clear the way for my account of solidarity offered below by briefly
   mentioning some contrasting and complementary approaches. In recent
   studies of solidarity, two overlapping concerns have been salient. One
   is to counter interpretations of solidarity that make it unduly insular
   and defined by exclusive, closed bonds of shared experience or loyalty.
   The other is to counter interpretations of solidarity that render it
   unduly political in the sense of being instrumental and strategic rather
   than viewing it as a form of life that can give expression to a
   normative moral or political ideal. The first problem of overly thick
   solidarity in which certain beliefs and values are so deeply shared that
   they are beyond debate, is addressed by Jodi Dean. She presents a
   critique of what she calls `conventional solidarity', and defines a
   counter-notion of `reflective solidarity'-a space of mutuality in which
   in which genuine difference, discursive conflict, and pluralism would be
   at home and neither uncritical consensus nor the predominance of only
   one group of voices would prevail. Focusing on the second problem, Carol
   Gould and Craig Calhoun both seek ways of introjecting a cosmopolitan
   orientation into the practice of solidarity. Gould does so by aligning
   it with justice and human rights in the formation of global networks of
   political activity. And Calhoun, whose emphasis is more on discursive
   agency, does so by exploring how a more universal kind of solidarity can
   emerge from the ongoing discourse within the public sphere. In contrast
   to these concerns that the bonds of solidarity will be overly tight and
   narrowly nationalistic, ethnic or localized, Avery Kolers is concerned
   that bonds of solidarity will not be thick enough to override the
   primacy of individual judgment and conscience. Then the practice of
   solidarity will be too weak and will ultimately break down into
   something irresolute and individualistically self-serving, whether in
   the authentic form of Quaker witness inspired by inner light or the
   inauthentic moral narcissism of radical chic. `Conscience just isn't
   enough to enable us to comprehend the nature of grave evils or our role
   in them,' he writes. `Ultimately we must overcome conscience in favor of
   solidarity horizontal ellipsis Conscience is directed at ensuring one's
   own moral integrity rather than at fostering the political movement that
   could secure moral results that challenge one's standing.
   ` Solidarity on Kolers's view is about taking sides and deferring to the
   views of others concerning why and how their rights and interests should
   prevail. It is a political practice that attempts to achieve moral
   outcomes, rather than one that is constitutive of moral norms. It gives
   voice primarily to those for whom solidarity is enacted, rather than
   containing within its own practice the standard of parity of voice and
   agency toward which it aims as an achieved political condition for all.
   Thus Kolers defines solidarity as `reason-driven political action on
   other's terms'. This appeal to deference sets him apart from the more
   dialogic and egalitarian interaction envisioned by Dean, Gould, and
   Calhoun in their various ways. He is taken by the danger that both
   reflective or dialogic communication and the self-correcting function of
   networks of solidarity will subtly reinforce forms of domination and
   power instead of overcoming them. By integrating the notion of right
   recognition of the moral standing of others, I am trying to understand
   thick relationships of community and more abstract and principled
   commitments to justice and respect for persons as orientations that can
   mutually inform and refine one another. My strategy is to conceptualize
   the practice of solidarity in developmental and transformational ways so
   that the practice of solidarity contains within itself a shaping of
   moral psychology and moral learning, from relatively thin commitments at
   first, to increasingly strong commitments over time, as a deeper
   understanding of the other fuels a kind of political and ethical
   maturity in oneself. Important groundwork for the perspective on
   solidarity that I offer here has been laid by Barbara Prainsack and
   Alena Buyx, whose work provides an institutional and structural analysis
   of solidarity, distinguishing among various levels of social
   organization within which it can be practiced. I agree that in
   understanding solidarity as a practice one cannot ignore the interaction
   between agency and the institutional structures within which agency
   takes place. Nor should one take solidarity as an abstract regulative
   idea rather than a concept whose philosophical and motivational force
   develops in and through active social practices. Nonetheless, my own
   approach tends to be more moral psychological, stressing the cognitive
   and motivational bases for a growth of understanding and cooperation
   among self and other in the practice of solidarity. Among those actively
   working on the concept, my thinking about solidarity is perhaps closest
   to that of Andrew Mason, who is primarily interested in the concept and
   practices of community, but who crucially brings community and
   solidarity into close theoretical proximity. He offers a study of what
   might be called `comparative relationalities', and I am attempting to
   follow along these lines here with a comparative discussion of
   solidarity and care. For his part, Mason deploys solidarity and
   community together not so much by characterizing solidarity as more
   intense and intimate than it is often taken to be, nor by making
   community less so, but by circumventing a dichotomous view (the legacy,
   one might say, of Aristotle and Kant alike) altogether. He builds
   solidarity into a normative conception of community, and his formulation
   is worth considering at length: A community is not just a group of
   people who share a range of values and a way of life, identify with the
   group and its practices, and recognize each other as fellow members.
   In order for a group to constitute a community in the moralized sense,
   two further conditions need to be met. First, there must be solidarity
   between its members. `Solidarity' is a multiply ambiguous notion, but in
   the sense I intend it consists in mutual concern: minimally this means
   that members must give each other's interests some non-instrumental
   weight in their practical reasoning. horizontal ellipsis Second, there
   must be no systematic exploitation or (on some versions) no systematic
   injustice. My own specific concern is to accentuate the normative
   aspects of this type of interpretation of the practices of solidarity
   and care: how persons and groups are recognized within these practices;
   what stance or posture persons and groups take toward one another; and
   how their standing as free and equal members of a moral community is
   constituted and sustained by these practices. The practice of solidarity
   begins with the latent possibilities of a given place at a given time.
   It builds on senses of historical memory and tradition, and it feeds on
   the gratitude felt when one remembers the service and contributions that
   others have made to one's way of life in the past, or when one has the
   moral imagination to foresee the contributions that newcomers can make
   in the future. Solidarity begins with the recognition of reciprocal and
   symbiotic interdependence among members of a moral community and then
   intervenes in-interrupts-an ongoing community when it is unjustly
   exclusionary and refuses to recognize the moral standing of some within
   it. Solidarity inherently leads us to view our own lives and agency as
   bound together with the rights, well-being, health, and dignity of
   others here and now. I take the fundamental gesture and stance of
   solidarity to be standing up beside another, thereby signaling publicly
   one's recognition of that person's (or group's) moral standing. In
   addition, there are three distinct postures agents assume toward others
   whose moral standing is in need of defense. These may be called standing
   up for, standing up with, and standing up as.Standing up for. This mode
   of solidarity assumes the stance of advocacy. It involves assisting,
   defending, and pleading the cause of the other. It stands up against
   exclusion and oppression. In general discussions of solidarity, the
   other is often taken to be a stranger, but that is not necessary; it
   makes perfect sense to talk about being in solidarity with friends and
   acquaintances. Moreover, the other need not be a human individual: one
   can stand up for other species, an ecosystem, or a cultural way of life.
   What is crucial is that there is some kind of power or knowledge
   differential between self and other in a relationship of solidarity and
   some kind of injustice or danger impinging upon the life of the other.
   This kind of solidarity can advocate for improved treatment or benefits
   for an oppressed or vulnerable group, but does not necessarily challenge
   the underlying basis for their subordinate social status. Yet, if it
   does not undermine structural inequalities, standing up for solidarity
   can perpetuate subordination rather than achieve equality.Standing up
   with. Solidarity as standing up with takes another step in the
   recognition of moral standing. Moving from the standpoint for to the
   standpoint with requires deeper engagement with the experience and
   lifeworld of the other.
   The difference created by the specificity of lifeworlds nonetheless
   resides within an overarching interpretive commonality, namely, the
   ability to understand lifeworlds other than one's own. Without such
   understanding, others cannot truly be treated with respect, they can
   only be tolerated, benignly neglected, not interfered with. This closer
   understanding can tend to humanize and personalize the relationship
   further, and the potential benefit becomes more reciprocal. Those who
   stand with others may find their own initial prejudgments concerning
   others transformed by the encounter. Those who practice solidarity must
   open themselves to the opportunity-and risk-it poses. Relating to other
   people or groups in the specificity of their values and vocabularies of
   self-interpretation can simultaneously develop respect for the specific
   standpoints of others. It can also enable a greater capacity for
   intercultural and transpersonal interpretive understanding broadly
   within a democratic political culture and way of life.Standing up as.
   The third standpoint is solidarity as standing up as. Obviously this
   suggests a yet stronger degree of identification between the providers
   of solidaristic support and the recipients of such support. The
   solidarity of standing up as involves finding a kind of covering
   connection that does not negate diversity among individuals at all, but
   rather establishes the grounds of its respect, protection, and
   perpetuation. To move through the trajectory of solidarity is to move in
   the direction of greater imaginative creativity and range in the moral
   life. Standing up for depends upon a kind of abstract moral commitment
   to support the application of general norms to the life situation of the
   other as a being with a certain inherent moral status. It thereby
   embraces shared moral norms (equal protection of the law, universal
   human rights), but without necessarily embracing the lived reality and
   distinct perspectives of the other. Standing up with involves adopting a
   perspective that is more internal to the lifeworld and the contextually
   meaningful agency of the other. Standing up as returns to generality, in
   the sense of a recognition of common humanity, a global or planetary
   membership, but also moves one imaginatively more deeply into a
   comprehension of difference and the distinctive individuality of the
   other. As the moral recognition of the other is altered by this
   interpretive journey, so is the moral imagination of the self. Arguably
   a growth in one's capacity to project oneself imaginatively into the
   perspective and viewpoint of the other person, and a growth in moral
   awareness or the ability to see connections previously unseen are
   plausible outcomes of the interpretive transformation effected by the
   trajectory of solidarity. The practices of solidarity mainly arise in
   the face of morally aberrant and unjust situations that are stifling
   human potential and where those being oppressed or suppressed need
   mobilized support and recognition. What the recipients of solidarity
   need, and the agents of solidarity provide, is affirmation and tangible
   support. In contrast, what the recipients of care need, and the agents
   of care provide, is attention. Though closely related and mutually
   reinforcing in many ways, solidarity and care are not the same, as
   affirmation and attention are different stances with different moral
   significance and developmental potentials. The practices of care are
   premised on situations that are neither aberrant nor unjust per se but
   are an inherent part of human species-being.
   Like solidarity, care also deepens the moral imagination of both those
   who care for others and those who are cared for by others. If focusing
   on solidarity shifts away from individualism and independence toward
   mutuality and interdependence, focusing on care shifts away from the
   individualism of self-reliance to an individuality validated by reliance
   on others. The practices of care are called forth where a common
   background condition of potential fragility, vulnerability,
   insufficiency, and mortality take center stage in the lives of persons
   in need or trouble and in the lives of those around them. Care offers a
   universalism that is concrete and thick. It is quite possible to imagine
   (and to find close empirical approximations of) societies where
   solidarity is absent. Not so with care. Even the subjugated and
   impoverished society of the Ik so strikingly (and controversially)
   described by Colin Turnbull, retained ways of caring for their very
   young, if not for their very old. They almost, but not quite, lost their
   cultural concept of care. Care theorists, such as Eva Feder Kittay,
   point out that universalism is biologically grounded on the necessity of
   maternal care. Every living human being has in common the fact that once
   they were cared for by someone (female or male) who took on a mothering
   role and relationship with them. This commonality extends backward in
   time. All persons who cared as a mother for a child were able to do so
   only because mothering had been extended to them by a previous
   generation. Human society fundamentally depends on the production and
   reproduction of this structure of care-giving roles and relationships.
   Equality, Kittay argues, is not based on properties that an individual
   possesses by virtue of who that individual is, but instead on properties
   that one possesses by virtue of properties that another person has or
   once had. In keeping with this, care theorist Joan Tronto also views
   care as a concrete universal, or a `species activity' and has proposed
   that caring: includes everything that we do to maintain, continue, and
   repair our `world' so that we can live in it as well as possible. That
   world includes our bodies, our selves, and our environment, all of which
   we seek to interweave in a complex, life-sustaining web. This provides
   yet another reason to distinguish between solidarity and care.
   Solidarity is based on who the other is as an individual human being and
   on `properties' they possess, if by properties we mean something like
   their moral standing and considerability, their entitlement to dignity
   and to respect for their human rights. When it comes to care, however,
   we are dealing not so much with recognition due to persons as with the
   ongoing, intergenerational, evolutionary web of living that all
   practices of care at any given moment are a part of. Solidarity is a
   response that unjustly denied recognition and moral standing calls for.
   Caring is a response that need calls forth, drawing on cognitive
   commitments and emotional capabilities that previous practices of caring
   have made possible. Care, like all the practices that relational
   bioethics examines and evaluates, should not be defined as good or just
   in all circumstances and in all its forms. The important work of ethical
   specification and judgment is skipped over when we equate care with
   virtues such as agape (selfless love of the other) and caritas
   (charity), or with social emotions such as other-regarding altruism or
   sympathy.
   Thus it is important to ask what substantive values should inform caring
   as a moral practice and its effects. How best to describe the stance and
   intentionality of caring, its transformative moral psychological effects
   on agents of care and recipients, and its role in governing structural
   and institutional power so as to mitigate the tension between social
   order and social diversity? With these questions in mind, I turn again
   to construct a developmental moral phenomenology of the practice of
   care. Before presenting my own account, I should note that Tronto has
   already offered something akin to what I have in mind. She distinguishes
   among caring about, taking care of, care giving, and care receiving.
   Caring about denotes the initial recognition of another's need for care.
   Taking care of involves assuming responsibility for the determined need
   of the other and undertaking steps to meet that need. Care giving
   involves assuming a more direct, physical, and intimate role in the
   practices of care. Need can be recognized and attended to in many
   distanced and indirect ways, but giving care is hands-on, physical work.
   It signifies a new level of commitment and engagement than the other
   forms the activity of care can take. Finally, care receiving as a
   distinct component of the practice of care recognizes that the recipient
   will often be a responsive agent in the care relationship. These
   distinctions are helpful, particularly in the context of Tronto's
   concern with the ethically and democratically appropriate
   institutionalization of the practices of care in a society as a whole. I
   seek, on the other hand, to explore a structured growth of moral
   awareness that may be illuminating to ascribe to the praxis of care, as
   I have tried to do with solidarity. The fundamental stance of the
   practice of care is to pay attention to. Just as right recognition of
   personhood and moral standing is fundamental to the solidaristic posture
   of standing up beside, so too the directed gaze of attention is
   fundamental to the posture of care. When someone, a student or a
   distracted friend during a conversation, is called upon to pay
   attention, their focus shifts and even their bodily orientation may
   change: they open their eyes, they listen actively, they lean in. Right
   recognition here comes from becoming visible to another as a sign of
   acknowledgment and respect. In some cultures and settings, paying
   attention to someone takes the form of making eye contact as a sign of
   such respect; in others, deliberately not making eye contact has the
   same significance. Both are gestures and postures of care. In this
   sense, the propensity to attend, to care, is not primarily biological or
   reflexive; it is a mode of culturally meaningful agency, it is a wink
   rather than a blink. Standing up beside the oppressed-and up against the
   oppressor-is a gesture that extracts `payment' in the form of public
   witness, which can incur negative sanctions or give one an aura of
   virtue by association. Paying attention to is also not cost-free in
   terms of its effects on plans in one's life or on other persons, whom
   the practice of care displaces from one's attention. Solidarity sets
   priorities, care balances and reshuffles them. Finally, on this account
   of the moral phenomenology of care, the presence of physical or
   psychological limitation or impairment is not primarily what calls forth
   the duty to care, although it is often the trigger for an intensified
   focus of attention and the commencement of new caring relationships and
   services.
   The moral raison d'etre of paying attention to is the evil of
   invisibility, disregard, and abandonment. Willie Loman's wife, Linda,
   understood this in Death of a Salesman, when she called upon her son to
   care for his father. `Attention must be paid.' She was not asking him to
   help Willie with his medications. The need for care is indeed universal,
   both biologically and culturally, because it responds to vulnerability,
   suffering, and mortality. However, being erased and deserted, reduced to
   bare self-reliance, having to fend for oneself alone-these conditions
   are neither universal nor inevitable. They are potentials in the human
   condition that the practice of care was morally and culturally invented
   to prevent, just as the practice of solidarity was invented to prevent
   the evil of misprision. And failure to prevent these evils not only
   diminishes the humanity of those who did not receive attention and
   recognition, but also diminishes those who failed to give them. There
   are three distinct postures that agents of care assume toward others in
   need. No doubt there are many more, but I want to single these out here.
   I shall call them attentive rehabilitation, attentive companionship, and
   attentive commitment. These moments in the practices of care are
   relational interactions between individuals or groups, with each side
   having voice (to the extent possible) and engaging in a give and take of
   initiative and response. However, as with my analysis of solidarity,
   this is presented primarily from the perspective of the agent of care
   rather than the other receiving care.Attentive rehabilitation of the
   other. To care is to take steps to rehabilitate or return the other in
   need to a situation of enhanced living or, as Tronto aptly puts it,
   repairing the other's world. If return to the status quo ante is
   impossible, rehabilitative attention becomes a project of helping to
   construct a new mode of life that will be meaningful and sustainable for
   the other, who will then go on to live with-and in spite of-social or
   physical limitations. This is the aspect of care that is perhaps closest
   to care giving and care provision in a professional sense. It is
   certainly based on respectful recognition of the moral standing of the
   patient, but its main hallmark is efficacy in the restoration of
   function. It is also the aspect of care that is closest in intention to
   solidarity, for the attention paid here is largely affirming, and the
   line I have tried to draw between affirmation and attention is blurred.
   But to probe more deeply into the dimensions of care that have to do
   with suffering and loss of self and meaning, we need to move beyond
   restoration and repair.Attentive companionship with and for the other.
   Companionship is an aspect of care that includes, but is not limited to,
   physically spending time together and direct communication, as humanly
   important as they are. Companionship, in the sense I am trying to get
   at, lays the groundwork for a developing sense of promise, presence, and
   assurance in the minds and hearts of both the agent of care and the
   other. Companionship recognizes the evil of abandonment and is one of
   the most powerful answering responses to this evil on behalf of the
   human good. It is difficult to say what concept best conveys the aspect
   of care that can provide this reassurance and abiding sense of
   connection between and among individuals and groups. Promise connotes
   perhaps too formal and legalistic a sense. Loyalty connotes something
   perhaps overly psychological.
   Friendship is tempting but again may suggest an affection or emotional
   bond that is stronger than I want to convey for this aspect of care.In
   any case, the reassurance of a promise of non-abandonment is what is
   built into this mode of attentiveness. Note that this reassurance
   applies, albeit differently, to both the agent and the recipient of
   care. My notion is that the suffering experienced by those with unmet
   needs for care takes place against an ever-present prospect of being
   left alone. Those young and well often ask to be left alone, not
   realizing truly what they are inviting, when what they actually want is
   more privacy and a less intrusive care presence. Caring as attentive
   companionship makes the grim prospect of abandonment recede in the
   other's imagination and hence palliates the suffering-often in the form
   of dread, anxiety, and loss of self-confidence and self-esteem-they
   experience.To move into a mode of attentive companionship in the care
   process is clearly a step beyond rehabilitation. What prompts such a
   step, or better, what is germinated by it? My answer is a new sense of
   gratitude in the moral imagination of the agent of care. It may be the
   gratitude felt for the newly arrived life of an infant, and the
   realization of how vital the assurance of non-abandonment will be to the
   developmental flourishing of the child. It may be intergenerational
   gratitude that is reciprocal, as when adult children alter their own
   lives and priorities to assure companionship to an ailing or lonely
   parent. It may be a sense of obligation or debt based on remembering the
   constructive activities of the other, which indirectly has been of
   significant social and individual benefit to the attentive companion.
   This is the case, for example, in care-providing institutions that serve
   military veterans, and this moral sensibility could indeed be extended
   to all, military and non-military alike, who have sacrificed for the
   sake of public service. Or it may be itself a form of solidarity at the
   heart of the practice of care, because it is based on recognition of the
   human value of rescuing a person from fear and despair to give them a
   better chance of flourishing in the future.Attentive commitment to the
   other. This represents a stronger and deeper sense of caring connection,
   in which the caring agent has internalized a stronger sense of duty and
   embraced a longer-term, and maybe more arduous, promise to the care
   recipient. However, the notion of care as attentive commitment to,
   precisely because it takes in a longer time horizon, can bring out the
   structural and public policy dimensions of the practice of care, as
   well. The fact is that individuals and private groups (like families)
   cannot actually sustain this modality of care without significant
   social, economic, and institutional support. Part of their commitment
   would be to work toward building systems of public provision for care
   services in their role as democratic citizens. Indeed, the politics of
   social insurance and long-term care policy in the United States would be
   altered if millions of unpaid family care givers could find the
   information, time, and energy to mobilize in favor of new financing and
   service delivery systems.
   To the extent that we want to develop an ecology of care-the creation of
   a cultural ethos and an institutional framework that promotes and
   supports practices of care not only in the household and family but also
   in the public sphere and the civil society-then we must link practices
   of care to forms of democratic political reform to make society more
   just, equitable, and conducive to health and well-being. Within the
   broader political economy and social welfare policy of a nation, paying
   attention in private life and in public policy-civic care-can reinforce
   one another. The practice of care can sometimes be imperious and
   domineering. And all too often caring becomes merely custodial. Yet,
   when it realizes its full moral promise, care offers nurture,
   protection, provision, and support for the other. It does not so much
   domineer as give the person receiving it a new insight about his or her
   own life. Since the need for care often follows injury, illness, and
   loss of various kinds, care offers hope through a new way of seeing the
   positive possibilities present in a given situation. It sustains purpose
   in the face of diminution. Care among humans is a transaction among
   individuals who are the authors of their own acts and lives, despite
   their need, impairment, or limitations. But they are symbiotic, not
   solipsistic, authors. Like solidarity, care is grounded in the gratitude
   felt when one recognizes the service and contributions that others have
   made to one's way of life. And like the practice of solidarity, the
   practice of care interrupts an ongoing form of life in order to be
   present with another in the face of their need, vulnerability, and
   suffering, finally winning through to a life well lived. Solidarity and
   care can arise developmentally out of an engagement with the vocation of
   repairing a needful, vulnerable, responsive world. The author declares

   varied, in English, than that related to solidarity. I have chosen to
   use the term `care' rather than resort to terms such as caring, care
   giving, care providing, and the like. When conjoined with the concept of
   a practice, care should be understood always to connote a dynamic
   pattern of agency, intention, and action over time. For my purposes in
   this article, this pattern and its consequences are more important than
   specific acts performed within practices of care, such as direct
   physical assistance with activities of everyday living, psychological
   assistance, ensuring comfort and safety, and the like. Care is touching,
   but as John Dewey pointed out, it is also minding. See Boydston, J. A.

   THE MORAL TRAJECTORY OF CARE CONCLUSION CONFLICT OF INTEREST Footnotes
   Many working in bioethics today are engaging in forms of normative
   interpretation concerning the meaningful contexts of relational agency
   and institutional structures of power. Using the framework of relational
   bioethics, this article focuses on two significant social practices that
   are significant for health policy and public health: the practices of
   solidarity and the practices of care. The main argument is that the
   affirming recognition of, and caring attention paid to, persons as moral
   subjects can politically motivate a society in three respects. The
   recognition of solidarity and the attention of care can prompt
   progressive change toward a democratic willingness: (a) to provide for
   equal respect for rights and dignity; (b) to provide the social
   resources and services needed for just health and well-being; and (c) to
   focus its creativity and wealth on the actualization of potential
   flourishing of each and all. Solidarity is discussed as a morally
   developmental stance that moves from standing up for another, standing
   up with another, and standing up as another. Care is discussed as a
   morally developmental stance that moves from the attentive
   rehabilitation of another, attentive companionship with and for another,
   and attentive commitment to another.},
