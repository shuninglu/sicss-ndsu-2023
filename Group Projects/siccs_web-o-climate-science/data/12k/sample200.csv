The Role of Trust in Communicating Scientific Consensus and the Environmental Benefits of Genetically Engineered Crops: Experimental Evidence of a Backfire Effect,ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNICATION-A JOURNAL OF NATURE AND CULTURE,"Genetically engineered (GE) crops are likely to be one solution when it comes to balancing the needs of a growing human population and changing climate. Recent data suggest that many U.S. adults believe that GE foods are risky for human health and the environment, despite scientific consensus that they are no more harmful to human health or the environment than conventionally bred crops. While some evidence suggests that consensus messaging could be a significant factor in publics' perceptions about technologies like GE, the effect of communicating scientific consensus and under different conditions remains unclear. We test message effectiveness in terms of individuals' consensus perceptions and beliefs about the environmental risks and benefits of GE technology. We find that consensus messaging reduces perceived environmental risks of GE crops, and that supplementing a consensus message with benefits information reduces perceived environmental risks and increases anticipated benefits. We find an interaction effect for trust in scientists, such that those who have lower trust in industry scientists exhibit a backfire effect when exposed to consensus information.",ENVIRON COMMUN,JAN 2,2023,10.1080/17524032.2023.2165523,Communication; Environmental Studies,9C5WX,WOS:000910731300001
Anthropogenic climate change has altered primary productivity in Lake Superior,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"Anthropogenic climate change has the potential to alter many facets of Earth's freshwater resources, especially lacustrine ecosystems. The effects of anthropogenic changes in Lake Superior, which is Earth's largest freshwater lake by area, are not well documented (spatially or temporally) and predicted future states in response to climate change vary. Here we show that Lake Superior experienced a slow, steady increase in production throughout the Holocene using (paleo)productivity proxies in lacustrine sediments to reconstruct past changes in primary production. Furthermore, data from the last century indicate a rapid increase in primary production, which we attribute to increasing surface water temperatures and longer seasonal stratification related to longer ice-free periods in Lake Superior due to anthropogenic climate warming. These observations demonstrate that anthropogenic effects have become a prominent influence on one of Earth's largest, most pristine lacustrine ecosystems.",NAT COMMUN,JUN 9,2017,10.1038/ncomms15713,Multidisciplinary Sciences,EX1EQ,WOS:000402963800002
Using the Plan-Do-Study-Act model: Pacesetters experiences,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE QUALITY ASSURANCE,"Purpose - This article aims to analytically review the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) model used in the Pacesetters national programme evaluation. Design/methodology/approach - The evaluation team's two-fold role is outlined: supporting project teams to develop PDSA plans and collect evaluation data. Four case studies are used to show the PDSA model's application and effect in a participatory action learning approach. Despite limitations, it is clear that all four case studies illustrate the PDSA model's potential benefits in a participatory evaluation approach, which involves public and patients. Findings - The model's effectiveness is premised on several enabling factors such as: teams appreciating the model; a climate that values all learning and open to re-planning; engaging any external evaluators whose role is clearly communicated to all project stakeholders in a timely fashion. Practical implications - There are clear intentions to promote evidence-based commissioning in the UK that values patient and public involvement. The PDSA model has the potential to test and implement changes in real work-place settings and to involve the public in evaluation. Originality/value - Case study analysis identifies new reflections on the PDSA model's use to support innovative NHS practice development with public involvement in a participatory",INT J HEALTH CARE Q,NA,2013,10.1108/IJHCQA-09-2011-0053,Health Policy & Services,V86PA,WOS:000212598900014
FOREST BELTS IN SOUTH-WEST OF ROMANIA (OLTENIA REGION),"ECOLOGY, ECONOMICS, EDUCATION AND LEGISLATION, VOL III","The purpose of this paper is to highlight the evolution of windbreaks areas in Romania, especially in the South-West Oltenia area, the importance and the measures that can be applied in order to increase these areas. Due to climate change and massive deforestation, some of the most serious problems facing most frequently Romania and in particular the SW Oltenia are: desertification and landslides. The role of forest curtains is found primarily in the benefits of agriculture, protecting human settlements and ways of communication and transport and not least the environmental benefits. The period taken into analysis was 8 years starting from 2005 and ending with 2013. Analysis was carried in the dynamics of some indicators such as: surface of the forest fund, the surface subjected to the regeneration process, the surface of the forest curtains and were contextual presented their interpretations. In Romania the forest fund covers an area representing approx. 27.3% of the total land surface below the European Union average, which is around 32%. The share of forest area in the South-West Oltenia is 12.4% of the total forest in Romania. The area subject to regeneration process, in the analysed period decreases and also in Romania forest area decreased from 36% in the nineteenth century to 27% today. The areas subjected to the regeneration process in Romania decreased by 12.2% in 2013 compared to 2005. It also note that natural regeneration decreased abruptly. It is recommended to increase the area subjected to natural regeneration because it is more efficient from economic perspective. In Romania there are about 2.2 million ha of degraded agricultural land, which are no longer suitable for an efficient agriculture and are recommended to be introduced into the forestry fund. In the South-West Oltenia setting up of protective forest curtains is a necessity. Reality ascertained ever since 1880. In this region it was proposed setting up of forest curtains on a surface of 12009 ha but being achieved so far only 63 ha. In order to increase the area covered by forest curtains it is recommended give some facilities to the landowners who give their consent for the setup of these curtains.",INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,NA,2015,NA,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",BE3JU,WOS:000370815400040
Climate-induced variations in global wildfire danger from 1979 to 2013,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"Climate strongly influences global wildfire activity, and recent wildfire surges may signal fire weather-induced pyrogeographic shifts. Here we use three daily global climate data sets and three fire danger indices to develop a simple annual metric of fire weather season length, and map spatio-temporal trends from 1979 to 2013. We show that fire weather seasons have lengthened across 29.6 million km(2) (25.3%) of the Earth's vegetated surface, resulting in an 18.7% increase in global mean fire weather season length. We also show a doubling (108.1% increase) of global burnable area affected by long fire weather seasons (>1.0 sigma above the historical mean) and an increased global frequency of long fire weather seasons across 62.4 million km(2) (53.4%) during the second half of the study period. If these fire weather changes are coupled with ignition sources and available fuel, they could markedly impact global ecosystems, societies, economies and climate.",NAT COMMUN,JUL,2015,10.1038/ncomms8537,Multidisciplinary Sciences,CO0OV,WOS:000358852600002
Canadian Weathercasters' Current and Potential Role as Climate Change Communicators,ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNICATION-A JOURNAL OF NATURE AND CULTURE,"Climatologists worldwide are calling for urgent action to manage climate change, but public engagement remains a significant challenge. This lack of engagement is often attributed to psychological distance: climate change is perceived as something happening far away, to other people, or in a hypothetical future. TV weathercasters are ideally situated to communicate the geographically and temporally proximate impacts of climate change and increase public engagement. This study explores the status of climate change reporting amongst weathercasters in Canada, where no such research has been conducted. The respondents suggested that many, but not all, weathercasters are engaged with climate change and interested in presenting local, climate-related content; however, their on-air climate change communication behavior is highly limited. This analysis builds on research conducted with American weather broadcaster by indicating that Canadian weathercasters share their potential as effective climate change communicators, but are highly uncertain about their capacity to support this role.",ENVIRON COMMUN,AUG 18,2019,10.1080/17524032.2018.1557726,Communication; Environmental Studies,IM1EN,WOS:000477731400008

Community-Based Research as a Mechanism to Reduce Environmental Health Disparities in American Indian and Alaska Native Communities,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,"Racial and ethnic minority communities, including American Indian and Alaska Natives, have been disproportionately impacted by environmental pollution and contamination. This includes siting and location of point sources of pollution, legacies of contamination of drinking and recreational water, and mining, military and agricultural impacts. As a result, both quantity and quality of culturally important subsistence resources are diminished, contributing to poor nutrition and obesity, and overall reductions in quality of life and life expectancy. Climate change is adding to these impacts on Native American communities, variably causing drought, increased flooding and forced relocation affecting tribal water resources, traditional foods, forests and forest resources, and tribal health. This article will highlight several extramural research projects supported by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Science to Achieve Results (STAR) tribal environmental research grants as a mechanism to address the environmental health inequities and disparities faced by tribal communities. The tribal research portfolio has focused on addressing tribal environmental health risks through community based participatory research. Specifically, the STAR research program was developed under the premise that tribal populations may be at an increased risk for environmentally-induced diseases as a result of unique subsistence and traditional practices of the tribes and Alaska Native villages, community activities, occupations and customs, and/or environmental releases that significantly and disproportionately impact tribal lands. Through a series of case studies, this article will demonstrate how grantees-tribal community leaders and members and academic collaborators-have been addressing these complex environmental concerns by developing capacity, expertise and tools through community-engaged research.",INT J ENV RES PUB HE,APR,2015,10.3390/ijerph120404076,"Environmental Sciences; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",CG7MT,WOS:000353488500043
Media Literacy as a Key Strategy toward Improving Public Acceptance of Climate Change Science,BIOSCIENCE,"Without public trust of climate change science, policymaking in a democratic society cannot address the serious threats that we face. Recent calls for proposals to increase climate literacy from federal agencies such as NASA, NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), and the National Science Foundation illustrate the urgency of this crisis. Although more climate change education is certainly needed, focusing solely on climate literacy will not garner public trust and may leave out high-impact media literacy education. Climate change deniers have been more effective educators than scientists and science educators because their messages are (a) empowering, built on the premise that every individual can quickly learn enough to enter public discourse on climate change; and (b) delivered through many forms of media. A more effective strategy for scientists and science educators should include not only discourse approaches that enable trust, with emphasis on empowerment through reasoning skills, but also approaches that embrace the maturing discipline of media literacy education.",BIOSCIENCE,MAR,2011,10.1525/bio.2011.61.3.8,Biology,730QQ,WOS:000288049600008
Marketing Communication and Reputation Building of Leading European Oil and Gas Companies on Instagram,ENERGIES,"The overall transition towards a low-carbon economy is expected to pose a solution for several global problems, including the ongoing climate change while ensuring economic and social development. Large oil and gas companies are aware of the need to transform their business, turn to renewable and clean energy sources to build a positive image and reputation, and have the economic power to do so. This paper aims to evaluate the marketing communication of leading European oil and gas companies on their Instagram accounts in the context of reputation building through using social media and identify to what extent the companies reflect the environmental aspects of corporate social responsibility. Content analysis and the Social Blade tool were used to examine the marketing communication of the five biggest companies by revenue. All the companies are active on Instagram, but it has been found that the Russian companies have remained inactive and have even been losing followers since March 2022, when the war conflict in Ukraine started. Surprisingly, Shell uploaded only a few posts during the reference period but is recognized as the company achieving the highest social media effectiveness. Although all observed oil and gas companies continue their business as usual, they incorporate and communicate efforts to support the development of electromobility, clean and renewable energy projects, as well as ecological projects.",ENERGIES,NOV,2022,10.3390/en15228683,Energy & Fuels,6K0PG,WOS:000887215000001
Networking of integrated pest management: A powerful approach to address common challenges in agriculture,CROP PROTECTION,"Integrated pest management (IPM) is facing both external and internal challenges. External challenges include increasing needs to manage pests (pathogens, animal pests and weeds) due to climate change, evolution of pesticide resistance as well as virulence matching host resistance. The complexity of designing effective pest management strategies, which rely less heavily on the use of conventional pesticides, is another external challenge. Internal challenges include organizational aspects such as decreasing trend in budget allocated to IPM research, increasing scarcity of human expertise, lack of knowledge transfer into practice and the communication gap both at country level and between countries, and lack of multi-, inter- and transdisciplinary IPM research. There is an increasing awareness that trans-national networking is one means to overcome such challenges and to address common priorities in agriculture. A large number of stakeholders (researchers, policy makers, growers And industries) are involved in the sector of crop protection, which needs to be coordinated through effective communications and dynamic collaboration to make any IPM strategy successful.

"Making Meat, Better: The Metaphors of Plant-Based and Cell-Based Meat Innovation",ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNICATION-A JOURNAL OF NATURE AND CULTURE,"A variety of advocates argue that industrialized animal food production creates major problems related to the global food supply, climate change, animal suffering, and diet-related public health maladies. The alternative protein sector - encompassing both the nascent cell-based meat industry (also known as cultured, lab-grown, clean, cultivated, or in vitro meat) and the long-standing but evolving enterprise of plant-based meat production - has emerged in response. With a focus on the reality-defining power of metaphors, this article draws from a mixed set of qualitative materials to investigate the perspectives of alternative protein advocates, identifying two dominant conceptual metaphors that permeate their discourse. First, the metaphor that meat is made aims to transform the concept of meat itself, such that it is decoupled from its long-standing connection to animal farming and is understood instead as a set of tastes and textures that can be reconstructed through food science and biotechnology. Second, the metaphor of the market for alternative meats situates innovation, capital investment, and insights from behavioral economics and marketing as the primary agents for creating a post-animal bioeconomy. At the same time as these metaphors highlight particular aspects of the enterprise, they also serve to downplay a set of public concerns, including those related to the sector's overall public health, cultural, economic, and ecological impacts. At a moment when alternative meats are being granted increased public attention, understanding the metaphors that characterize the industry offers environmental communication scholars the opportunity to examine its promise and limitations.",ENVIRON COMMUN,OCT 2,2020,10.1080/17524032.2020.1725085,Communication; Environmental Studies,NU4QI,WOS:000519647300001
Fuel Efficient Route Planning Using VANET,"2018 IEEE 9TH ANNUAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, ELECTRONICS AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION CONFERENCE (IEMCON)","Traffic congestion due to overloaded road infrastructure is a key contributing factor of global warming. Dynamic route planning (DRP) of vehicles can be helpful to reduce congestion and provide faster and more fuel-efficient trips for vehicles. VANET (Vehicular Ad Hoc Network) and its associated WAVE (Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment) standards facilitate this process, by allowing vehicles to share accumulated travel data with each other and plan their routes based on the gathered information. Communication and decision making can be carried out using centralized or distributed approach and should consider network usage and scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel and scalable dynamic route planning approach that uses real-time traffic information to update vehicle routes. We introduce the concept of a delay threshold at intersections to identify traffic congestion and propose a hybrid metric that considers average travel time and occupancy rate for each road segment. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed approach can lead to reductions in trip time and carbon emissions.",NA,NA,2018,NA,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",BM2QM,WOS:000461314200077
Optimism and alienation - colour schemes and soundscapes as means for the social construction of risk in climate education videos,SOCIAL SEMIOTICS,"While the field of climate change communication has become increasingly interested in visual representations, there has been a lack of research that attempts to capture the breadth and variety of semiotic resources being drawn upon in the contemporary media landscape. In this paper, social semiotic theory is drawn upon for investigating how colour and sound may contribute to the social construction of risk in a sample of four professionally produced Norwegian educational videos, all of which are aimed at explaining the reality and danger of anthropogenic climate change. The results indicate that the colour schemes and soundscapes of the videos contribute meaning potentials with affective resonances apt for the social construction of risk, and that the videos construe the risk differently. The authors suggest that in two of the sampled videos, the uses of colour and sound are apt for attenuating the risk perceived by the viewer, while in two other videos they are used in a manner apt for amplifying the perceived risk. Implications of these results are discussed in light of previous research on multimodal climate communication.",SOC SEMIOT,MAR 15,2023,10.1080/10350330.2020.1838871,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; Communication; Linguistics",G7MR5,WOS:000584809000001
Renewable Energy Assisted Traffic Aware Cellular Base Station Energy Cooperation,ENERGIES,"With global concern for climate change, and for cutting down the energy cost, especially in off grid areas, use of renewable energy has been gaining widespread attention in many areas including cellular communication. The base station (BS) has emerged as a strong candidate for the integration of renewable energy sources (RES), particularly solar and wind. The incorporation of renewable energy opens many possibilities for energy conservation through strategies such as energy cooperation between BSs during the off-peak hours, when the energy harvested from renewable energy sources may become surplus. In this paper, we present the case for cellular BSs enabled with renewable energy sources (RES) to have an arrangement in which the BS provide surplus energy to a neighboring BS, thus minimizing the use of conventional energy. A realistic objective is developed for northern region of Pakistan, which entails modeling of solar panels and wind-turbine according to the average solar irradiation and wind speed of the region. We also model the dynamic load of the BS, which depicts temporal fluctuations with traffic variations. Based on these models we initiate an energy cooperation scheme between the BS in which an energy cost minimization framework is mathematically modeled and solved through the interior point method algorithm. Results are obtained for different times of the year for different number of base stations showing respective energy cost savings.",ENERGIES,JAN,2018,10.3390/en11010099,Energy & Fuels,FV2LG,WOS:000424397600099
A Bridge to Where? Tracing the Bridge Fuel Metaphor in the Canadian Media Sphere,FRONTIERS IN COMMUNICATION,"This paper examines how Canadian media have discussed the role of natural gas in climate change mitigation from 2016 to 2019. It also explicates different stakeholders' varying stances on the environmental impacts of North America's ongoing shale gas boom, as manifested in their conflicting attitudes toward designating unconventional gas as a bridge to a low-carbon future. The data in question consist of 99 articles published by Canadian media sources, all of which included explicit references to either bridge fuel or transition fuel. Through a qualitative thematic analysis, I found that more than half of the articles adopted the conventional definition of bridge fuel. Meanwhile, there are three less common, yet noteworthy interpretations arising out of the rest of the articles, which conflict with each other in terms of their views on the relationship between unconventional gas and greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Overall, the fact that bridge fuel references only appeared in a fraction of Canadian environmental and energy news reports during the target period suggests the issue's peripheral status in the Canadian media sphere. Given this situation, the paper ends by calling for more knowledge mobilization efforts to raise public awareness of the controversial factors underlying expanding unconventional gas production and consumption.",FRONT COMMUN,DEC 17,2020,10.3389/fcomm.2020.586711,Communication,TQ0BS,WOS:000677956000001
Elements of fishing community resilience to climate change in the coastal zone of Bangladesh,JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION,"Resilience has been conceptualized in various ways by anthropologists, ecologists, systems scientists and engineers; the boundaries of resilience are subjective and context dependent. Consequently, choosing the standards and metrics for assessing resilience remains key challenges for policy makers. In this study, using multicriteria evaluation of 40 basic criteria of human, physical, financial, natural and social assets, we have identified several elements, such as experienced fishermen, natural abundance of hilsa (Tenualosa ilisha), ability to assert decision on fish selling, nets and boats ownership, social harmony and capacity of buying food as essential livelihood assets for the fishermen at Hatiya Island, Bangladesh. These assets may enhance the relative resilience of the fishing community of the island to climate change by as much as 20-40%.

Environmental framing on Twitter: Impact of Trump's Paris Agreement withdrawal on climate change and ocean acidification dialogue,COGENT ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE,"The role of social media in communicating emerging environmental issues has received little attention. One such issue is ocean acidification (OA), the process by which carbon dioxide (CO2) acidifies oceans. Although scientists consider OA to be as dangerous as climate change (CC) and both problems are caused by excess CO2 emissions, public awareness of OA is low. We investigated public discussions about CC and OA on Twitter, identifying frames and tweeter characteristics. Tweeting patterns before and after President Trump's 1 June 2017 announcement of the U.S.'s withdrawal from the international Paris Climate Agreement were compared because of the potential for diverse framing of this globally communicated event. For CC tweets, Political/Ideological Struggle (PIS) and Disaster (DS) frames were prevalent, with PIS frames increasing threefold after Trump's announcement. DS, Settled Science (SS), and Promotional frames were prevalent among OA tweets, with SS decreasing and PIS increasing after the announcement. Our findings suggest that Trump's decision sparked discourse on CC and facilitated expressions of politicized opinions on Twitter.

"Weather, Climate, and the Economy: Explaining Risk Perceptions of Global Warming, 2001-10",WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY,"Two series of national survey datasets (2001-10), supplemented with monthly temperature and precipitation data and unemployment data, are used to examine how weather and climate, economic performance, and individuals' sociodemographic backgrounds and political orientations affect public perceptions of global warming. Consistent with previous studies, political orientations play a key role in determining public perceptions of global warming. Democrats and liberals are more likely than Republicans and conservatives to see global warming as an immediate and serious problem. Sociodemographic characteristics are also shown to be significant factors, with young people, women, and racial minorities likely to show higher concern about global warming than their counterparts. Moreover, individuals with lower income and higher levels of education tend to be more concerned about global warming. Net of these factors, summer temperature trends over the past 10 years, among other weather and climate measures, are shown to have consistently positive effects on public perceptions of global warming. This suggests that individuals who have experienced increasing summer heat are most likely to perceive immediate impacts and severity of global warming.

Waterless tanning: chrome tanning in ethanol and its derivatives,RSC ADVANCES,"An approach towards waterless tanning is crucial to address present challenges faced by humanity such as global warming and the depletion of water resources. Here, green solvent alternatives to water such as ethanol, ethyl acetate and ethyl lactate were employed for both pickle-based and pickle-less chrome tanning. The results show that an ethanol medium appears to be the best solvent for chrome tanning in terms of color, chromium uptake and other bulk properties of tanned leathers. Extensive studies indicate that chrome tanning in the ethanol medium leads to a higher exhaustion (87% for pickle-based and 95% for pickle-less), better chromium content, distribution and shrinkage temperature, and low chromium leaching in tanned leathers compared to water mediated tanning. Both visual and electron microscopic analyses demonstrate a comparable grain structure and fiber architecture in tanned and crust leathers. Similarly, the strength and organoleptic properties of crust leathers are also comparable between ethanol and water mediated tanning. The process enables the reduction of COD, BOD and TS loads in the composite liquor by 14-26, 21-28 and 42-46%, respectively. The leather properties are not altered upon recycling of the chromium containing ethanol liquor up to two times. These results suggest that it is possible to replace water with ethanol for chrome tanning, which offers great potential for sustainable leather manufacture with solvent recycling.",RSC ADV,NA,2015,10.1039/c5ra11740b,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",CO6FC,WOS:000359251600038
Integrating regional conservation priorities for multiple objectives into national policy,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"Multinational conservation initiatives that prioritize investment across a region invariably navigate trade-offs among multiple objectives. It seems logical to focus where several objectives can be achieved efficiently, but such multi-objective hotspots may be ecologically inappropriate, or politically inequitable. Here we devise a framework to facilitate a regionally cohesive set of marine-protected areas driven by national preferences and supported by quantitative conservation prioritization analyses, and illustrate it using the Coral Triangle Initiative. We identify areas important for achieving six objectives to address ecosystem representation, threatened fauna, connectivity and climate change. We expose trade-offs between areas that contribute substantially to several objectives and those meeting one or two objectives extremely well. Hence there are two strategies to guide countries choosing to implement regional goals nationally: multi-objective hotspots and complementary sets of single-objective priorities. This novel framework is applicable to any multilateral or global initiative seeking to apply quantitative information in decision making.",NAT COMMUN,SEP,2015,10.1038/ncomms9208,Multidisciplinary Sciences,CT7TJ,WOS:000363017100036

"First, do no harm-Missing data treatment to support lake ecological condition assessment",ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE,"Indicators of ecological condition status of water bodies associated with field measurements are often subject to data gaps. This obstacle can often lead to abandonment of assessment. Furthermore, it can lead to the use of methods, based merely on their availability.

A combination of algorithms with hierarchical clustering of results is used. A particular emphasis is put on the preparation and interpretation of input data and the role of an expert in the workflow. The proposed approach enhances the decision-making process by improving communication and transparency throughout interactions between experts, analysts and decision makers.

Framing agricultural policy through the EC's strategies on CAP reforms (1992-2017),AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD ECONOMICS,"The periodic reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) are announced each time by a strategic document in the form of a Communication by the European Commission (EC). The content of the last Communication differs from previous ones, which raises the questions of what frames the EC has employed with respect to its CAP reforms and how these frames have been modified over the past 26 years (from 1991 to 2017) in order to legitimise the preservation of the CAP. This paper tries to fill the gap in the research of frames in the main strategic documents on the CAP by employing comparative historical framing analysis. The results show consistent use of five frames: the policy mechanism frame, farmers' economic frame, foreign trade frame, budgetary frame, and the societal concerns frame. While they have all remained in use, most have been changed significantly over the years. Throughout the analysed period, the farmers' economic frame has retained its primacy and continuity, demonstrating the power of the farmers' lobbies and conservative member states. If in the initial Communications the environment was barely present within the societal concerns frame, it has gained importance in the recent Communications, in addition to other general societal issues, such as climate change, food security and quality, health, digitalisation, innovation, and even migration. By marginalising the policy mechanism frame and replacing it with the implementation model and increasingly emphasising the societal concerns frame with social justifications of the CAP, the EC is trying to legitimise the CAP after 2021.",AGR FOOD ECON,NOV 2,2021,10.1186/s40100-021-00178-4,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics,WQ1OH,WOS:000713590600001

Subpolar North Atlantic western boundary density anomalies and the Meridional Overturning Circulation,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"Changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, which have the potential to drive societally-important climate impacts, have traditionally been linked to the strength of deep water formation in the subpolar North Atlantic. Yet there is neither clear observational evidence nor agreement among models about how changes in deep water formation influence overturning. Here, we use data from a trans-basin mooring array (OSNAP-Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program) to show that winter convection during 2014-2018 in the interior basin had minimal impact on density changes in the deep western boundary currents in the subpolar basins. Contrary to previous modeling studies, we find no discernable relationship between western boundary changes and subpolar overturning variability over the observational time scales. Our results require a reconsideration of the notion of deep western boundary changes representing overturning characteristics, with implications for constraining the source of overturning variability within and downstream of the subpolar region. Western boundary current variability in the subpolar North Atlantic is thought to reflect interior convection changes and determine Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation variability. Here, the authors show with an extended OSNAP time series that neither linkage is robust due to the complex dynamics in the region.",NAT COMMUN,MAY 24,2021,10.1038/s41467-021-23350-2,Multidisciplinary Sciences,SO1VW,WOS:000658768100001
Pacific Climate Change and ENSO Activity in the Mid-Holocene,JOURNAL OF CLIMATE,"The authors argue that a reduction to the stochastic forcing of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation ENSO) wrought by Pacific-wide climate changes in response to mid-Holocene 6000 BP) orbital forcing is a viable hypothesis for the observed reduction of ENSO activity during that time. This conclusion is based on comprehensive analysis of an intermediate coupled model that achieves significant reduction to ENSO variance in response to mid-Holocene orbital forcing. The model's excellent simulation of the tropical Pacific interannual variability lends credibility to the results. Idealized simulations demonstrate that the mid-Holocene influence is communicated to the tropical Pacific largely via climate changes outside of the tropical Pacific, rather than from insolation changes directly on the tropical Pacific. This is particularly true for changes to the ENSO, but also with changes to the cold tongue annual cycle. Previously proposed mechanisms for teleconnected mid-Holocene ENSO changes, including forcing of ENSO by a strengthened Asian summer monsoon and an increase in the annual cycle forcing on the tropical Pacific leading to a reduction in ENSO activity by frequency entrainment, do not appear to occur in these simulations. Rather, the authors show that the modeled mid-Holocene climate exhibits a pronounced reduction in Pacific meridional mode activity that has been recently shown to be a forcing on ENSO, though the reasons for this reduction are still to be explained. The contrasting nature of the results compared to previous studies highlights the effect of the prevailing ENSO paradigm on this problem. By showing that an externally forced ENSO model is equally capable of explaining mid-Holocene ENSO reduction as its nonlinear, weakly chaotic counterpart, it is demonstrated that the mid-Holocene ENSO data point cannot yet discriminate between these two paradigms of ENSO.",J CLIMATE,FEB 15,2009,10.1175/2008JCLI2644.1,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,419TO,WOS:000264242800004
Protection and consolidation of stone heritage by self-inoculation with indigenous carbonatogenic bacterial communities,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"Enhanced salt weathering resulting from global warming and increasing environmental pollution is endangering the survival of stone monuments and artworks. To mitigate the effects of these deleterious processes, numerous conservation treatments have been applied that, however, show limited efficacy. Here we present a novel, environmentally friendly, bacterial self-inoculation approach for the conservation of stone, based on the isolation of an indigenous community of carbonatogenic bacteria from salt damaged stone, followed by their culture and re-application back onto the same stone. This method results in an effective consolidation and protection due to the formation of an abundant and exceptionally strong hybrid cement consisting of nanostructured bacterial CaCO3 and bacterially derived organics, and the passivating effect of bacterial exopolymeric substances (EPS) covering the substrate. The fact that the isolated and identified bacterial community is common to many stone artworks may enable worldwide application of this novel conservation methodology.",NAT COMMUN,AUG 17,2017,10.1038/s41467-017-00372-3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,FD9TK,WOS:000407864800001
Enclosed stigma contributes to higher spikelet fertility for rice (Oryza sativa L.) subjected to heat stress,CROP JOURNAL,"With global warming, rice plants may be subjected to heat stress more regularly during the heatsensitive flowering stage, causing spikelet sterility and grain yield loss. Stigma exsertion is considered to increase pollen reception and promote female reproductive success. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of stigma exsertion on spikelet fertility at high temperatures. Five rice cultivars (Liangyoupeijiu, Shanyou 63, Huanghuazhan, Nagina 22, and IR64) with differing degrees of stigma exsertion were cultivated and exposed to high temperature at anthesis. Heat-tolerant cultivars did not always show a high percentage of spikelets with exserted stigmas, and vice versa. Irrespective of the presence of more pollen grains on exserted stigmas, spikelets with exserted stigmas did not show greater spikelet fertility than spikelets with fewer exserted stigmas or hidden stigmas under heat stress. GA(3) application augmented the percentage of spikelets with exserted stigmas; however, it did not increase spikelet fertility under heat stress. Spikelet fertility of whole panicles was negatively correlated with the percentage of spikelets with exserted stigmas, but positively with that with hidden stigmas. Viability of the hidden stigmas was less reduced than that of exserted stigmas under heat stress, suggesting that hidden stigmas have an advantage in maintaining viability. Heat stress delayed anther dehiscence and reduced the viabilities of both exserted stigmas and pollens, thereby causing low spikelet fertility. Together, these results suggest that high spikelet fertility does not depend on stigma exsertion and that enclosed stigma generally contributes to higher spikelet fertility and heat tolerance under high-temperature conditions during flowering in rice.

Climate change and stewardship: strategies to build community resilience in the Capricorn Coast,AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,"The Great Barrier Reef is projected to change substantially over the next 50 years due to the impacts of climate change. These impacts are likely to have severe repercussions for the communities and industries that depend on resources and services provided by the marine ecosystem. Understanding ways to increase community resilience to the impacts of climate change are essential. This study sought to identify barriers and opportunities to foster stewardship action among stakeholders on the Capricorn Coast to build community-based resilience to the impacts of climate change. Barriers to stewardship exemplify the need to develop clear communication networks between community and government agencies to foster trust and interconnectivity. Education also plays an important role in these processes in allowing for information and knowledge transfer across the different stakeholder sectors. To facilitate and reduce these barriers to stewardship, strong leadership, which engages industry and community members, by industry and government organisations, is necessary. To do this, stakeholders will need to acknowledge the uncertainty around climate change impacts, yet be provided with information and knowledge of the resources available to respond to climate-related impacts as well as being encouraged and empowered to make individual changes in the greater interest of the reef.",AUSTRALAS J ENV MAN,SEP,2012,10.1080/14486563.2011.646755,Environmental Studies,009RI,WOS:000309042500003
Comprehension of climate change and environmental attitudes across the lifespan,ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GERONTOLOGIE UND GERIATRIE,"Given the coincidence of the demographic change and climate change in the upcoming decades the aging voter gains increasing importance in climate change mitigation and adaptation processes. It is generally assumed that information status and comprehension of complex processes underlying climate change are prerequisites for adopting pro-environmental attitudes and taking pro-environmental actions. In a cross-sectional study, we investigated in how far (1) environmental knowledge and comprehension of feedback processes underlying climate change and (2) pro-environmental attitudes change as a function of age. Our sample consisted of 92 participants aged 25-75 years (mean age 49.4 years, SD 17.0). Age was negatively related to comprehension of system structures inherent to climate change, but positively associated with level of fear of consequences and anxiousness towards climate change. No significant relations were found between environmental knowledge and pro-environmental attitude. These results indicate that, albeit understanding of relevant structures of the climate system is less present in older age, age is not a limiting factor for being engaged in the complex dilemma of climate change.

Climate risk management practices of fish and shrimp farmers in the Mekong Region,AQUACULTURE ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT,"As comparative multi-country studies are rare, not much is known about the effects of regional differences in social-ecological conditions on the adoption of climate risk management practices in aquaculture. This study is based on a large-scale survey of practices of aquaculture operators in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. Climate-related risks to profits of aquaculture farms in the Mekong Region are typically managed alongside water-related, disease and other business risks. Farmers who were more concerned with risks to profitability had a history of undertaking more risk management practices. Farmers growing shrimp (rather than fish), or adopting more intensified production systems, had more risk management practices. Wealthier and more educated farmers had experience with more practices for dealing with current risks, as well as recognized the need for strategies to adapt to a changing climate in the future. Information access is a factor in the adoption of new practices and strategies. Adoption of aeration or use of information-communication technologies to manage climate-related risks, for example, was more likely among more educated and wealthy farmers who belonged to growers' groups. The findings also suggest that attitudes toward innovation, levels of investment and social norms influence adoption of technological, organizational and informational practices.",AQUACULT ECON MANAG,OCT 2,2021,10.1080/13657305.2021.1917727,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Fisheries,XX7TL,WOS:000664052300001

Potential climate engineering effectiveness and side effects during a high carbon dioxide-emission scenario,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"The realization that mitigation efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions have, until now, been relatively ineffective has led to an increasing interest in climate engineering as a possible means of preventing the potentially catastrophic consequences of climate change. While many studies have addressed the potential effectiveness of individual methods there have been few attempts to compare them. Here we use an Earth system model to compare the effectiveness and side effects of afforestation, artificial ocean upwelling, ocean iron fertilization, ocean alkalinization and solar radiation management during a high carbon dioxide-emission scenario. We find that even when applied continuously and at scales as large as currently deemed possible, all methods are, individually, either relatively ineffective with limited (<8%) warming reductions, or they have potentially severe side effects and cannot be stopped without causing rapid climate change. Our simulations suggest that the potential for these types of climate engineering to make up for failed mitigation may be very limited.",NAT COMMUN,FEB,2014,10.1038/ncomms4304,Multidisciplinary Sciences,AC6XA,WOS:000332668000004
How stable are preferences among emerging electricity generation technologies,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS,"Coal-fired power plants with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), natural-gas-fired power plants with CCS, and Small Modular Reactors (SMR) are potentially important emerging energy technologies that could help mitigate climate change and contribute to a low-carbon future. Public opinion and preferences towards these technologies will affect their adoption when they are technologically ready to be implemented. This study examines the nature and stability of public preferences among these options. We find that participants have internally consistent preferences, when tested in several ways. Overall, they prefer SMRs to natural gas with CCS to coal with CCS. On a group level, these preferences depend on the choice alternatives, but not on how fully the technologies are described nor how far away a hypothetical power plant would be sited. On the individual level, preferences are related to participants' perceptions of the technology and their political ideology. Our findings suggest that presenting the three technologies together will produce the most balanced, informed judgment, with the least influence of political ideology.",ENVIRON RES COMMUN,JUL,2019,10.1088/2515-7620/ab2ec0,Environmental Sciences,OA1ER,WOS:000577538400002
Assessing local and regional economic impacts of climatic extremes and feasibility of adaptation measures in Dutch arable farming systems,AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS,"We propose a method that combines local productivity factors, economic factors, crop-specific sensitivity to climatic extremes, and future climate change scenarios, to assess potential impacts of extreme weather events on agricultural production systems. Our assessment is spatially explicit and uses discounted time series of cash flows taking into account expected future impacts on yield and crop quality, to estimate changes in the expected net present value (NPV) of agricultural systems. We assess the economic feasibility of a portfolio of adaptation measures by considering their initial investments, annual costs, and effectiveness in reducing crop damage. We apply the method to investigate potential economic impacts of extreme weather events in arable farming systems in the Netherlands around 2050. We find that the expected increase in extreme weather events frequency can severely affect future productivity potential. Particularly, heat waves, warm winters, and high intensity rainfall are expected to substantially undermine the future economic viability of Dutch arable farming systems. The results indicate considerable differences between regions in terms of vulnerability to climatic extremes: while some regions are severely impacted by all climatic extremes, other regions consistently demonstrate high resilience to increases in extreme event frequency. The findings are robust to a wide range of scenarios and suggest that the interactions between economic factors and management practices (particularly, crop specialisation) are decisive drivers of the economic viability of agricultural systems under more frequent climatic extremes. However, the exact magnitude of the impacts remains highly uncertain, as we do not consider endogenous interactions in market conditions resulting from climate change and socio-economic developments. Nevertheless, crop adaptation measures should be regarded as no-regret strategies, since they alleviate both economic impacts and uncertainty around impact magnitude. The proposed method provides insights in region specific threats and opportunities that are relevant for stakeholders and policy-makers. This information improves communication on main climate risks at the local and regional levels and contributes to prioritising adaptation strategies.",AGR SYST,OCT,2017,10.1016/j.agsy.2017.06.013,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",FK1ZR,WOS:000413282600019
Parasites and Post-Truth Climate,JOURNAL OF LINGUISTIC ANTHROPOLOGY,"This article argues that the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), an exemplary climate change skeptical organization, attains persuasive power by striking up a parasitic relation to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and associated discourse genres. Drawing upon theories of citationality and genre, along with conceptual accounts of the parasite (Serres 2013 [1980]; Nakassis 2013; Kockelman 2010, 2017), I construe parasitism as an asymmetric structure of relation that recurs across various sites and scales. As parasitic actors, corporate climate change skeptics like the NIPCC imitate and incorporate host institutions and discourses in order to mine scientific authority while undermining scientific consensus regarding anthropogenic climate change. At the same time, this relation between organizations and their respective discourse genres generates informatic noise or static (French parasite) within established channels of popular science communication. In the case examined here, the NIPCC interrupts an economy of expertise within which the UN-sponsored IPCC holds a privileged position. An uncanny resemblance between the two organizations, between parasite and host, erodes the latter's claims to authority, just as a counterfeit coin erodes public trust in the currency it mimics.",J LINGUIST ANTHROPOL,MAY,2020,10.1111/jola.12257,Anthropology; Linguistics; Language & Linguistics,LI9CU,WOS:000502285700001
Significant variability of structure and predictability of Arctic Ocean surface pathways affects basin-wide connectivity,COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT,"The Arctic Ocean is of central importance for the global climate and ecosystem. It is a region undergoing rapid climate change, with a dramatic decrease in sea ice cover over recent decades. Surface advective pathways connect the transport of nutrients, freshwater, carbon and contaminants with their sources and sinks. Pathways of drifting material are deformed under velocity strain, due to atmosphere-ocean-ice coupling. Deformation is largest at fine space- and time-scales and is associated with a loss of potential predictability, analogous to weather often becoming unpredictable as synoptic-scale eddies interact and deform. However, neither satellite observations nor climate model projections resolve fine-scale ocean velocity structure. Here, we use a high-resolution ocean model hindcast and coarser satellite-derived ice velocities, to show: that ensemble-mean pathways within the Transpolar Drift during 2004-14 have large interannual variability and that both saddle-like flow structures and the presence of fine-scale velocity gradients are important for basin-wide connectivity and crossing time, pathway bifurcation, predictability and dispersion.

Photosynthetic H-2 metabolism in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (unicellular green algae),PLANTA,"Unicellular green algae have the ability to operate in two distinctly different environments (aerobic and anaerobic), and to photosynthetically generate molecular hydrogen (H-2). A recently developed metabolic protocol in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii permitted separation of photosynthetic O-2-evolution and carbon accumulation from anaerobic consumption of cellular metabolites and concomitant photosynthetic H-2-evolution. The H-2 evolution process was induced upon sulfate nutrient deprivation of the cells, which reversibly inhibits photosystem-II and O-2-evolution in their chloroplast. In the absence of O-2, and in order to generate ATP, green algae resorted to anaerobic photosynthetic metabolism, evolved H-2 in the light and consumed endogenous substrate. This study summarizes recent advances on green algal hydrogen metabolism and discusses avenues of research for the further development of this method. Included is the mechanism of a substantial tenfold starch accumulation in the cells, observed promptly upon S-deprivation, and the regulated starch and protein catabolism during the subsequent H-2-evolution. Also discussed is the function of a chloroplast envelope-localized sulfate permease, and the photosynthesis-respiration relationship in green algae as potential tools by which to stabilize and enhance H-2 metabolism. In addition to potential practical applications of H-2, approaches discussed in this work are beginning to address the biochemistry of anaerobic H-2 photoproduction, its genes, proteins, regulation, and communication with other metabolic pathways in microalgae. Photosynthetic H-2 production by green algae may hold the promise of generating a renewable fuel from nature's most plentiful resources, sunlight and water. The process potentially concerns global warming and the question of energy supply and demand.",PLANTA,OCT,2007,10.1007/s00425-007-0609-9,Plant Sciences,208JV,WOS:000249316500001

In this paper, we propose that the tremendous consequences of the corona crisis invite environmental psychology to focus more strongly on research questions that address major societal challenges from a collective psychology perspective. In particular, we stress that the corona crisis may affect how people appraise - and potentially respond to - the looming climate crisis. By consistently pointing out systemic links and their human factor, environmental psychology can become central to a scientific agenda of a sustainable 'post-corona society'. In order to provide a framework for future research towards a sustainable societal transformation, we build on the Social Identity Model of Pro-Environmental Action (SIMPEA) and extend its scope to understand people's responses following the corona crisis.

Social inequalities in climate change-attributed impacts of Hurricane Harvey,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"Climate change is already increasing the severity of extreme weather events such as with rainfall during hurricanes.

Here, we use climate change attribution science paired with hydrological flood models to estimate climate change-attributed flood depths and damages during Hurricane Harvey in Harris County, Texas. Using detailed land-parcel and census tract socio-economic data, we then describe the socio-spatial characteristics associated with these climate change-induced impacts. We show that 30 to 50% of the flooded properties would not have flooded without climate change. Climate change-attributed impacts were particularly felt in Latina/x/o neighborhoods, and especially so in Latina/x/o neighborhoods that were low-income and among those located outside of FEMA's 100-year floodplain. Our focus is thus on climate justice challenges that not only concern future climate change-induced risks, but are already affecting vulnerable populations disproportionately now.

Overcoming global inequality is critical for land-based mitigation in line with the Paris Agreement,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"Transformation pathways for the land sector in line with the Paris Agreement depend on the assumption of globally implemented greenhouse gas (GHG) emission pricing, and in some cases also on inclusive socio-economic development and sustainable land-use practices. In such pathways, the majority of GHG emission reductions in the land system is expected to come from low- and middle-income countries, which currently account for a large share of emissions from agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU). However, in low- and middle-income countries the economic, financial and institutional barriers for such transformative changes are high. Here, we show that if sustainable development in the land sector remained highly unequal and limited to high-income countries only, global AFOLU emissions would remain substantial throughout the 21st century. Our model-based projections highlight that overcoming global inequality is critical for land-based mitigation in line with the Paris Agreement. While also a scenario purely based on either global GHG emission pricing or on inclusive socio-economic development would achieve the stringent emissions reductions required, only the latter ensures major co-benefits for other Sustainable Development Goals, especially in low- and middle-income regions.

Can Wheat Beat the Heat: Understanding the Mechanism of Thermotolerance in Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.),CEREAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS,"Wheat is one of the staple food crops in major areas of the world providing the required carbohydrate and proteins in our diet. A decrease in the total yield of wheat has been observed worldwide due to elevation in environmental temperature. Heat stress causes pollen sterility, drying of stigmatic fluid, pseudo-seed setting, empty pockets in endosperm and shrivelled seeds in wheat. Every plant system has defence mechanisms to cope up with the different environmental challenges. The defence mechanisms of wheat consist of heat responsive miRNAs, signalling molecules, transcription factors and stress associated proteins like heat shock proteins (HSPs), antioxidant enzymes etc. Wheat is sensitive to heat stress especially in stages like pollination to milky dough kernel stages is critical for growth and development. Heat stress causes an oxidative burst inside cell system followed by increase in the expression of various proteins like protein kinases, HSPs and antioxidant enzymes. These stress proteins modulate the defence mechanisms of wheat by protecting the denaturation and aggregation of nascent proteins involved in various metabolic reactions. Genetic variation has been observed with respect to expression and accumulation of these stress proteins. Exogenous treatment of various hormones, signalling molecules and chemicals has been reported to enhance the thermotolerance level of wheat under heat stress. Tools of genetic engineering have been also used to develop wheat transgenic lines with over-expression of stress proteins under heat stress condition.

The Advanced Water Sport and Leisure Centre Project at The Water Edge of Dabie Lake in Szczecin (Poland),"3RD WORLD MULTIDISCIPLINARY CIVIL ENGINEERING, ARCHITECTURE, URBAN PLANNING SYMPOSIUM (WMCAUS 2018)","Szczecin is the town located in the Middle Ages in the 60 km distance from the Baltic Sea coastline. It is the unique town in Poland having in its limits over 30% of lake and river waters. The great potential of this fact has been used since ever for communication and transportation routes, for shipbuilding and port facilities. The XIX-century Szczecin was a significant industrial center, thanks to the location at Odra River and Dabie Lake. The negative result of industrialization was the heavy water pollution. In the recent years the inner - city waters are on one hand partly subject of protection as an Odra River Natural Park, Natura 2000 restricted area, but on the other hand more and more used for leisure and water sports. European Funds contribution made possible a severe limitation of water pollution by installation of ecologically advanced sewage purification plants. It was also possible due to the elimination of the old-type industry in the town and its surroundings and increase of ecological consciousness. Better quality of the water in the Dabie Lake and Odra River, on the edge to the city of Szczecin, attracts therefore touristic and leisure development and the growing welfare in Poland and Europe makes recreation facilities a new, attractive income source. The water-city edge project is aimed to transform the deteriorated brownfield at the Dabie Lake Waterfront into the place for health care, leisure and sport activities on the higher level of quality and proficiency. The paper describes the project ideas and visions. This project, still in development, shows the possibilities of alternative leisure developments to sea-coastal ones at the Baltic Sea Coast. It represents the method of combining different positive features of the climate and waterfront locations with the investment opportunities, what could contribute to a success of the one common, overall idea of leisure and sport center on the city edge.

Because drylands will largely expand into formerly productive ecosystems, this increase in dryland GPP may not increase global GPP. Further, GPP per unit dryland area will decrease as degradation of historical drylands outpaces the higher GPP of expanded drylands. Dryland expansion and climate-induced conversions among sub-humid, semi-arid, arid, and hyper-arid subtypes will lead to substantial changes in regional and subtype contributions to global dryland GPP variability. Our results highlight the vulnerability of dryland subtypes to more frequent and severe climate extremes and suggest that regional variations will require different mitigation strategies.",NAT COMMUN,APR 3,2020,10.1038/s41467-020-15515-2,Multidisciplinary Sciences,NG9AL,WOS:000564272800005
Signifying the imperative nexus between climate change and information and communication technology development: a case from Pakistan,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,"The globe has faced technological affluence that enormously revolutionized the lives of humankind. Today, the manufacturing process of the energy sector, production sector, agriculture sector, and service sector is exclusively or partially based on ICT tools. The key intention of this investigation is to find out the impacts of the utilization of ICT on CO(2)emission. However, this investigation also evaluates the influence of investment in ICT and the trade of ICT tools on CO(2)emission. Further, the estimation examined the subsistence of environment Kuznets curve (EKC) theory, for the nation of Pakistan. The investigation employed an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model and found that the utilization of ICT has a negative impact on CO(2)emission. Moreover, the long-run results revealed that the import of ICT equipment is more beneficial for the environment quality of Pakistan. However, ICT apparatus manufactured in Pakistan might produce electronic waste due to non-utilization of green technology. The study reported bidirectional causality between ICT and CO(2)emission. These results point towards that the emergence of ICT in industries and daily life possesses a significant and positive role in climate change in Pakistan. Also, this study corroborates the veracity of EKC in Pakistan.",ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,AUG,2020,10.1007/s11356-020-09128-x,Environmental Sciences,MO5NK,WOS:000551572300065
Population Dynamics in an Advective Environment,COMMUNICATIONS ON APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION,"We consider a one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation describing single- and two-species population dynamics in an advective environment, based on the modeling frameworks proposed by Lutscher et al. in 2006. We analyze the effect of rate of loss of individuals at both the upstream and downstream boundaries. In the single-species case, we prove the existence of the critical domain size and provide explicit formulas in terms of model parameters. We further derive qualitative properties of the critical domain size and show that, in some cases, the critical domain size is either strictly decreasing over all diffusion rates, or monotonically increasing after first decreasing to a minimum. We also consider competition between species differing only in their diffusion rates. For two species having large diffusion rates, we give a sufficient condition to determine whether the faster or slower diffuser wins the competition. We also briefly discuss applications of these results to competition in species whose spatial niche is affected by shifting isotherms caused by climate change.",COM APPL MATH COMPUT,2023 MAY 30,2023,10.1007/s42967-023-00259-9,"Mathematics, Applied",H7SM5,WOS:000997916800001
Groundwater-Related Risk Assessment,DEALING WITH CONTAMINATED SITES: FROM THEORY TOWARDS PRACTICAL APPLICATION,"Groundwater includes the pore water in the water-unsaturated upper soil layer as well as water usually referred to as groundwater, that is, the water in the water-saturated zone. Groundwater contains contaminants of natural and anthropogenic origin. It is generally recognised by all segments of society that fresh water is an immensely important resource. From a Risk Assessment point of view, groundwater needs to be approached from two different perspectives, namely, as an important protection target and as a means of transport (a pathway) for contaminants. For human beings the primary use for groundwater is as a source of drinking water. Although often underestimated, the water-saturated deeper soil layer is also a habitat for many organisms. For decades, there has been an on-going and interesting discussion concerning the intrinsic value of groundwater, sometimes including spiritual and even supernatural or religious arguments. Generally speaking, the transport of water and contaminants is much faster in the groundwater zone than in the water-unsaturated upper soil layer. Specific attention will be given in this chapter to the impact that a revised quantitative groundwater regime, the presence of heterogeneous soils or aquifers, surface water bodies, anthropogenic subsurface processes and structures, and heterogeneous soils and aquifers all have on groundwater quality.

A heterocyte glycolipid-based calibration to reconstruct past continental climate change,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"Understanding Earth's response to climate forcing in the geological past is essential to reliably predict future climate change. The reconstruction of continental climates, however, is hampered by the scarcity of universally applicable temperature proxies. Here, we show that heterocyte glycolipids (HGs) of diazotrophic heterocytous cyanobacteria occur ubiquitously in equatorial East African lakes as well as polar to tropical freshwater environments. The relative abundance of HG(26) diols and keto-ols, quantified by the heterocyte diol index (HDI26), is significantly correlated with surface water temperature (SWT). The first application of the HDI26 to a similar to 37,000 year-long sediment record from Lake Tanganyika provides evidence for a similar to 4.1 degrees C warming in tropical East Africa from the last glacial to the beginning of the industrial period. Given the worldwide distribution of HGs in lake sediments, the HDI26 may allow reconstructing SWT variations in polar to tropical freshwater environments and thereby quantifying past continental climate change.",NAT COMMUN,APR 23,2021,10.1038/s41467-021-22739-3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,SK8JE,WOS:000656461900007
A song of ice and vessels: Seasonal trends in the soundscape of the western arm of Lake Superior,JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH,"The soundscapes of marine systems have been studied for decades to determine spatial and temporal patterns of biological, geological, and anthropogenic activity. However, comparatively little is known about freshwater soundscapes. Lake Superior is the world's largest freshwater lake by surface area and home to a variety of aquatic animals. The Twin Ports of Duluth and Superior, located in the western arm of Lake Superior, are annually closed because of ice cover, providing a unique opportunity to explore sound levels in the absence of vessel traffic. Passive acoustic monitoring was conducted over 15 months between November 2018 and March 2020 to investigate seasonal patterns. Sound pressure levels were significantly lower (8 dB) at low frequencies (<100 Hz) during the winter and spring months (when ice cover increased). Quieter ambient sound pressure levels may provide an acoustic refuge to soniferous animals, especially those that vocalise during winter spawning. During the ice-free months, commercial shipping introduces a near continuous source of sound, increasing sound levels by up to 25 dB (at frequencies < 1,000 Hz). Climate change is expected to further reduce ice cover and thickness allowing the shipping season into the Twin Ports to be extended, thus warranting concern about the effect of noise from vessel activity on aquatic life. This study provides a baseline of the soundscape in the western arm of Lake Superior, against which scientists and environmental managers can assess future changes to this important habitat.

Response of carbon cycle to drier conditions in the mid-Holocene in central China,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"The nature and extent to which hydrological changes induced by the Asian summer monsoon affected key biogeochemical processes remain poorly defined. This study explores the relationship between peatland drying and carbon cycling on centennial timescales in central China using lipid biomarkers. The difference between peat n-alkane delta H-2 and a nearby stalagmite delta O-18 record reveals that intervals of prominent peatland drying occurred during the mid-Holocene. Synchronous with these drier conditions, leaf wax delta C-13 values show large negative excursions, with the utilization of CO2 respired from the peatland subsurface for plant photosynthesis being a possible mechanism. Crucially, successive drying events appear to have had a cumulative impact on the susceptibility of peat carbon stores to climate change. Concurrently, bacterially derived hopane delta C-13 values suggest the occurrence of enhanced methane oxidation during the drier periods. Collectively, these observations expand our understanding of how respiration and degradation of peat are enhanced during drying events.",NAT COMMUN,APR 10,2018,10.1038/s41467-018-03804-w,Multidisciplinary Sciences,GC1ED,WOS:000429521300011

The central role of advances in site investigation for development and construction is emphasized, as this can be reasonably described as the core activity for engineering geologists. Here the changes in desk studies, remote sensing, field mapping and various facets of ground investigations are examined. However, it is also necessary to highlight how global developments in communications and computing power have had an enormous impact on engineering geological practice, notably through on-site links between field teams and head office, and the creation of data management systems that allow complex ground conditions to be analysed and modelled. There have also been important improvements in on-site health and safety, the creation of professional qualifications and the adoption of international and national standards for all facets of ground engineering.

"Communicating the Inevitable: Climate Awareness, Climate Discord, and Climate Research in Peru's Highland Communities",ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNICATION-A JOURNAL OF NATURE AND CULTURE,The paper discusses how anthropology contributes to climate change research and communication. Building on theoretical works that highlight the cultural framing of communication it investigates the signs and symbols that a Peruvian highland community creates and the imaginaries and identities it generates to interpret and communicate climate change and its environmental impact. To explore the community's communicative repertoire the paper explores three climate voices that illuminate the conflicting ways the global discourse on climate change impacts the community's future visions. Arguing that anthropogenic climate change poses a new challenge to the communication of urgent public issues the paper asks: Should the communication discuss climate change as a matter-of-fact issue? Or should it present climate change as a cultural phenomenon that is acknowledged as an issue in dispute? The paper concludes that climate change research is a post-normal science that not only must engage a range of scholarly traditions and methods but also listen to the voices that are affected by climate change in the real world. It encourages climate change communicators to recognize that climate communication is a dialogical relation based on the mutual interests of its experts and its users in providing as well as receiving knowledge.,ENVIRON COMMUN,JAN 2,2020,10.1080/17524032.2019.1626754,Communication; Environmental Studies,KA4VQ,WOS:000480217700001
Urban heat indicator map for climate adaptation planning,MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE,"By 2050, 75 % of the world's population will live in cities and the occurrence of heat wave events might have doubled. Mapping the climate and land use change impact for urban heat events should set the agenda for adaptation planning at the local scale. Literature on urban heat mapping does not reveal a clear indicator to visualise the urban heat impacts that includes consequences of land use and climate changes for planning purposes. This paper introduces a stepwise approach to develop a single complex indicator to map the urban heat impact for local climate adaptation planning processes. Information on climatic drivers and land use characteristics are combined and projected for future land use and climate change impacts. Next, several visualisation techniques are developed to investigate which techniques are most effective to visualise complex information with multiple variables in one visualisation. A usability test is performed to investigate how indicator and map meet the information and communication needs of policy makers. Our findings reveal that it is important to add information on future impacts to set the agenda for adaptation planning at the local scale. Applying cartographic techniques in a map series presentation has proven to be effective to map complex information in a single image and fulfil most of the identified information needs.

Climate change on Twitter: Implications for climate governance research,WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE,"There is increasing public debate about the governance of climate change and its repercussions for nature and human livelihoods. In today's digitalized communication landscape, both public and private actors involved in climate change governance use social media to provide information and to interact with stakeholders and the broader public. This Focus Article discusses two main aspects of debates about climate change and climate governance on Twitter, which previous theories suggest to shape climate governance across domestic and global levels: non-state climate action and public opinion formation on the social media. We see significant advancement in the environmental social sciences studying these two areas. Yet, we also see the need for a better understanding of how public and private actors in the climate governance complex interact on Twitter, and how these actors shape, and are shaped by, experiences, values, and positions. This understanding will help to advance climate governance theories. This article proceeds in three steps. We first discuss previous social media research on non-state climate action and public opinion formation related to climate change and its governance. Then we sketch avenues for future research, elaborating how Twitter data might be used to investigate how non-state climate action and public opinion formation on social media are linked to and influence climate governance. We conclude by making the case for drawing together Twitter data and climate governance research into a more coherent research agenda.This article is categorized under:Policy and Governance > Private Governance of Climate ChangePerceptions, Behavior, and Communication of Climate Change > CommunicationPolicy and Governance > National Climate Change PolicyPolicy and Governance > Multilevel and Transnational Climate Change Governance",WIRES CLIM CHANGE,2023 JUN 18,2023,10.1002/wcc.848,Environmental Studies; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,J1NV9,WOS:001007353400001
DIGITAL MEDIA AND THE PERSONALIZATION OF COLLECTIVE ACTION Social technology and the organization of protests against the global economic crisis,INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,"Changes related to globalization have resulted in the growing separation of individuals in late modern societies from traditional bases of social solidarity such as parties, churches, and other mass organizations. One sign of this growing individualization is the organization of individual action in terms of meanings assigned to lifestyle elements resulting in the personalization of issues such as climate change, labour standards, and the quality of food supplies. Such developments bring individuals' own narratives to the fore in the mobilization process, often requiring organizations to be more flexible in their definitions of issues. This personalization of political action presents organizations with a set of fundamental challenges involving potential trade-offs between flexibility and effectiveness. This paper analyses how different protest networks used digital media to engage individuals in mobilizations targeting the 2009 G20 London Summit during the global financial crisis. The authors examine how these different communication processes affected the political capacity of the respective organizations and networked coalitions. In particular, the authors explore whether the coalition offering looser affiliation options for individuals displays any notable loss of public engagement, policy focus (including mass media impact), or solidarity network coherence. This paper also examines whether the coalition offering more rigid collective action framing and fewer personalized social media affordances displays any evident gain in the same dimensions of mobilization capacity. In this case, the evidence suggests that the more personalized collective action process maintains high levels of engagement, agenda focus, and network strength.",INFORM COMMUN SOC,NA,2011,10.1080/1369118X.2011.579141,Communication; Sociology,885ZN,WOS:000299820100002
User Selection and Engagement for Climate Services Coproduction,WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY,"Climate services are high on the international agenda for their potential to help combat the effects of climate change. However, climate science is rarely directly incorporated into the decision-making processes of societal actors, due to what has been identified as the usability gap. This gap is partially due to a failure to timely and meaningfully engage users in the production of climate services, as well as misperceptions as to which users can best benefit from climate service uptake. In this article, we propose user selection and engagement guidelines that integrate important values from participatory science such as those of legitimacy, representativity, and agency. The guidelines consist of 5 1 1 steps: defin-ing why, where, whom, which attributes, and which intensity and how to select and engage with stakeholders. While these steps may be initially implemented by an ideally interdisciplinary team of scientists and service designers, the final step consists of an iterative process by which each decision is agreed on together with the identified users and stakeholders under a coproduction approach. We believe this systematic user selection and engagement practice is key to support the design of climate services aligned to the actual needs of a wide and inclusive range of empowered societal agents. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: A review of the climate science and services literature and related research projects reveals that, despite the insistence to include users in all stages of the research process, users are often involved only sporadically and inconsistently and when there is little room to change the climate service suitable for decision-making. Here, we argue that a reason for this is the lack of user selection and engagement guidelines. Failure to implement a re-search design strategy for these decisions can lead to a lack of usability and applicability of the produced climate-related services, as well as hampering their long-term uptake. These guidelines can thus support the development of usable, coproduced, actionable climate science.",WEATHER CLIM SOC,APR,2023,10.1175/WCAS-D-22-0112.1,Environmental Studies; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,H5PR6,WOS:000996485500001
Fire air pollution reduces global terrestrial productivity,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"Fire emissions generate air pollutants ozone (O-3) and aerosols that influence the land carbon cycle. Surface O3 damages vegetation photosynthesis through stomatal uptake, while aerosols influence photosynthesis by increasing diffuse radiation. Here we combine several state-of-the-art models and multiple measurement datasets to assess the net impacts of fire-induced O-3 damage and the aerosol diffuse fertilization effect on gross primary productivity (GPP) for the 2002-2011 period. With all emissions except fires, O-3 decreases global GPP by 4.0 +/- 1.9 Pg C yr(-1) while aerosols increase GPP by 1.0 +/- 0.2 Pg C yr(-1) with contrasting spatial impacts. Inclusion of fire pollution causes a further GPP reduction of 0.86 +/- 0.74 Pg C yr(-1) during 2002-2011, resulting from a reduction of 0.91 +/- 0.44 Pg C yr(-1) by O-3 and an increase of 0.05 +/- 0.30 Pg C yr(-1) by aerosols.

Event-Based Storylines to Address Climate Risk,EARTHS FUTURE,"The climate science community is challenged to adopt an actionable risk perspective, which is difficult to align with the traditional focus on model-based probabilistic climate change projections. Event-based storylines can provide a way out of this conundrum by putting emphasis on plausibility rather than probability. This links directly to common practices in disaster risk management using stress-testing for emergency preparedness based on events that are conditional on specific and plausible assumptions. Event-based storylines allow for conditional explanations, without full attribution of every causal factor, which is crucial when some aspects of the latter are complex and highly uncertain. Plain Language Summary One of today's major challenges is how to use insights and information from climate sciences to inform decision-making regarding managing risks from climate change, where weather and climate extremes represent a major component of climate-related risk. So far, climate science has taken a probabilistic approach producing large model ensembles and exploring likely ranges, thereby neglecting low-likelihood but potentially high-impact events that pose significant risks to society. Event-based storylines are emerging as an alternative way to explore future high-impact events while taking into account aspects of vulnerability and exposure of the considered system with an emphasis on plausibility rather than probability. This concept links directly to common practices in disaster risk management using stress-testing for emergency preparedness based on events that are conditional on specific, but plausible assumptions. When co-developed by climate scientists and stakeholders, event-based storylines can be informed by physical climate and impact modeling and can provide a useful way of communicating and assessing climate-related risk in a specific decision-making context.",EARTHS FUTURE,FEB,2021,10.1029/2020EF001783,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",QP4OU,WOS:000623816500015
Granulosa cell-derived extracellular vesicles mitigate the detrimental impact of thermal stress on bovine oocytes and embryos,FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Climate change-induced global warming results in rises in body temperatures above normal physiological levels (hyperthermia) with negative impacts on reproductive function in dairy and beef animals. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), commonly described as nano-sized, lipid-enclosed complexes, harnessed with a plethora of bioactive cargoes (RNAs, proteins, and lipids), are crucial to regulating processes like folliculogenesis and the initiation of different signaling pathways. The beneficial role of follicular fluid-derived EVs in inducing thermotolerance to oocytes during in vitro maturation (IVM) has been evidenced. Here we aimed to determine the capacity of in vitro cultured granulosa cell-derived EVs (GC-EVs) to modulate bovine oocytes' thermotolerance to heat stress (HS) during IVM. Moreover, this study tested the hypothesis that EVs released from thermally stressed GCs (S-EVs) shuttle protective messages to provide protection against subsequent HS in bovine oocytes. For this, sub-populations of GC-EVs were generated from GCs subjected to 38.5? (N-EVs) or 42? (S-EVs) and supplemented to cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) matured in vitro at the normal physiological body temperature of the cow (38.5?) or HS (41?) conditions. Results indicate that S-EVs improve the survival of oocytes by reducing ROS accumulation, improving mitochondrial function, and suppressing the expression of stress-associated genes thereby reducing the severity of HS on oocytes. Moreover, our findings indicate a carryover impact from the addition of GC-EVs during oocyte maturation in the development to the blastocyst stage with enhanced viability.",FRONT CELL DEV BIOL,APR 6,2023,10.3389/fcell.2023.1142629,Cell Biology; Developmental Biology,E4YW8,WOS:000975623500001
Benefit risk and cost ratios in sustainable food and health policy: Changing and challenging trajectories,ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION,"There is benefit, risk and cost in all that we do, but when it comes to food, we expect that it will benefit our health, be available, safe to eat and affordable. But as climate change and demographic shifts through displacement and ageing gather momentum, the emphases on each of benefit, risk and cost will alter. That we are ecological beings whose health and wellbeing are ecosystem-dependent, must now be the underpinning framework for risk management. Loss of natural environment and biodiversity represents reduced nutritional and health resilience, which will need to be factored in to risk assessment and management with climate change. This is proving a problematic risk communication challenge. Previously desirable food and food pattern recommendations will be tempered by substantial sustainability, availability, safety, affordability, equity and ethical considerations. Future workforces will need to ensure basic livelihoods (food, water, shelter, clothing, healthcare, education, communication, essential transport, resource management and effective governance) and with risk minimisation Cost appraisal will have less to do with monetisation and more to do with resource management in accordance with equity and ethical principles. Communities could adopt Liveability Units (LU) for traceability and community-based transactions, as a currency for a more sustainable future, encouraging and enabling food and health system viability.

Functional diversity along elevational gradients in the high altitude vegetation of the western Himalaya,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,"The analysis of species distribution and functional diversity (FD) in natural gradients of aridity and temperature at high altitudes could provide indication of future changes in plant communities as both are responsive to environment and strongly influence ecosystem functioning and stability. We established eleven altitudinal transects in high altitude region of western Himalaya, six of which represented north aspect and the rest represented south aspect. In each transect, vegetation was sampled randomly at every 200m elevation to estimate species rarity, niche width and different FD indices [community-weighted mean traits (CWM), functional richness (FRic), functional divergence (FDiv), functional dispersion (FDis) and functional specificity (FSpe)]. These indices indicate resource utilization, competition for resources, optimal plant strategies, and presence of functionally specialist species. We found a total of 418 plant species, most of which were having narrow niche and distribution. Proportion of species with narrow niche was high at higher elevations, 36.5% species were rare with 17% of them being endemic to Himalaya. At south aspect, lower values of CWM plant height along with lower FRic, FDiv, FDis, and FSpe were recorded. Further, CWM plant height, FRic, FDiv, FDis and FSpe significantly decreased with increasing elevation. Influence of gradients of aridity (aspect) and decreasing temperature (elevation) on species distribution and FD suggest that functioning of high altitude communities is very likely to be affected in future. Our findings therefore emphasize that the plant communities present at higher elevations are more vulnerable under climate change.",BIODIVERS CONSERV,JUL,2019,10.1007/s10531-019-01728-5,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences,IC0QN,WOS:000470665000003

The linkage between the diverse technologies, from the sensor network to the communication network, and the visualisation on the Internet are explained. The entire project has been planned using low-cost sensors, open source software, and minimal energy consumption. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND APPROACHES FOR IN SITU, AUTONOMOUS OBSERVING IN THE ARCTIC",OCEANOGRAPHY,"Understanding and predicting Arctic change and its impacts on global climate requires broad, sustained observations of the atmosphere-ice-ocean system, yet technological and logistical challenges severely restrict the temporal and spatial scope of observing efforts. Satellite remote sensing provides unprecedented, pan-Arctic measurements of the surface, but comple-mentary in situ observations are required to complete the picture. Over the past few decades, a diverse range of autonomous platforms have been developed to make broad, sustained observa-tions of the ice-free ocean, often with near-real-time data delivery. Though these technologies are well suited to the difficult environmental conditions and remote logistics that complicate Arctic observing, they face a suite of additional challenges, such as limited access to satellite services that make geolocation and communication possible. This paper reviews new platform and sensor developments, adaptations of mature technologies, and approaches for their use, placed within the framework of Arctic Ocean observing needs.",OCEANOGRAPHY,DEC,2022,10.5670/oceanog.2022.127,Oceanography,4N5FL,WOS:000854044700001
Using social representations theory to make sense of climate change: what scientists and nonscientists in Australia think,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,"The mass media has ensured that the challenging and complex phenomenon of climate change now has the household familiarity of a brand name. But what is it that is understood by climate change, and by whom? What frame of reference is drawn upon to communicate meaningfully about climate change? Do particular subgroups within our society hold different understandings, or have the debate and the prolific dissemination of information about this issue coalesced around a core perception or image of what climate change is? To answer these questions, we conceptualized climate change within the theory of social representations as emergent socially constructed knowledge. We analyzed word association data collected in Australia from persons identifying as having a scientific, government, or general public background (N = 3300). All respondents were asked to write the first words that came to mind when they thought about climate change. Comparative analyses of the word associations reveal that respondents from different backgrounds define climate change in different ways. The results suggest that there is a common core set of concepts shared by the different groups, but there are also a great many differences in how climate change is framed and conceived by respondents. The results are discussed in relation to what they imply for responses to climate change by these social groups and in relation to interventions designed to encourage climate adaptation.",ECOL SOC,NA,2014,10.5751/ES-06592-190319,Ecology; Environmental Studies,AR0GH,WOS:000343247200018
Temperature effects on the physiological status and reflex impairment in European grayling Thymallus thymallus from catch-and release angling,FISHERIES RESEARCH,"There is a growing body of research communicating how angler behaviour can be adjusted and optimised to reduce fish injury and impairment resulting from the capture of recreationally angled fishes. However, few studies have focused on how individual and interacting abiotic variables influence the outcomes of catch and release (C&R) angling. A population of European grayling Thymallus thymallus at their upper thermal limit of their geographic distribution provided a model cold-water species that was representative of other fishes sensitive to climate warming impacts and that are subjected to C&R across different seasons. Here, C&R angling for T. thymallus was conducted during summer (> 15 degrees C) and winter (< 10 degrees C), with 97 fish captured (220-490 mm). Measurement of tertiary stress responses (reflex impairment, as time to body equilibrium, an important predictor of post-release mortality) revealed that at > 15 degrees C, fish took significantly longer to regain equilibrium (178 +/- 44 s) than at < 10 degrees C (70 +/- 40 s). Multivariate testing revealed air exposure had a stronger effect on reflex impairment than fight time. Testing of post-capture, pre-release blood chemistry on sub-samples of captured fish revealed fish had significantly elevated levels of both glucose and lactate at > 15 degrees C versus < 10 degrees C, In entirety, these results suggest that stress responses and post-release mortality risk in cold-water fishes subjected to C&R could be reduced via temperature-informed fishery management practises, and by minimising, or ideally eliminating, air exposure",FISH RES,MAR,2019,10.1016/j.fishres.2018.11.014,Fisheries,HI9BW,WOS:000456751300020
"AtTGA4, a bZIP transcription factor, confers drought resistance by enhancing nitrate transport and assimilation in Arabidopsis thaliana",BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS,"To cope with environmental stress caused by global climate change and excessive nitrogen application, it is important to improve water and nitrogen use efficiencies in crop plants. It has been reported that higher nitrogen uptake could alleviate the damaging impact of drought stress. However, there is scant evidence to explain how nitrogen uptake affects drought resistance. In this study we observed that bZIP transcription factor AtTGA4 (TGACG motif-binding factor 4) was induced by both drought and low nitrogen stresses, and that overexpression of AtTGA4 simultaneously improved drought resistance and reduced nitrogen starvation in Arabidopsis. Following drought stress there were higher nitrogen and proline contents in transgenic AtTGA4 plants than in wild type controls, and activity of the key enzyme nitrite reductase (NIR) involved in nitrate assimilation processes was also higher. Expressions of the high-affinity nitrate transporter genes NRT2.1 and NRT2.2 and nitrate reductase genes NIA1 and NIA2 in transgenic plants were all higher than in wild type indicating that higher levels of nitrate transport and assimilation activity contributed to enhanced drought resistance of AtTGA4 transgenic plants. Thus genetic transformation with AtTGA4 may provide a new approach to simultaneously improve crop tolerance to drought and low nitrogen stresses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Monthly storminess over the Po River Basin during the past millennium (800-2018 CE),ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS,"Reconstructing the occurrence of diluvial storms over centennial to millennial time-scales allows for placing the emergence of modern damaging hydrological events in a longer perspective to facilitate a better understanding of their rate of return in the absence of significant anthropogenic climatic forcing. These extremes have implications for the risk of flooding in sub-regional river basins during both colder and warmer climate states. Here, we present the first homogeneous millennium-long (800-2018 CE) time-series of diluvial storms for the Po River Basin, northern Italy, which is also the longest such time-series of monthly data for the entire Europe. The monthly reconstruction of damaging hydrological events derives from several types of historical documentary sources and reveals 387 such events, allowing the construction of storm severity indices by transforming the information into a monthly, quantitative, record. A period of reduced diluvial storms occurred in the ninth and tenth centuries, followed by a stormier period culminating in the eleventh and thirteenth centuries. More complex patterns emerge in the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries, with generally wetter and stormier conditions than during other centuries. From the seventeenth century onwards the number of damaging hydrological events decreases, with a return in recent decades to conditions similar to those prior to the thirteenth century The flood frequency tended to increase for all seasons during periods of low solar irradiance, suggesting the presence of solar-induced circulation changes resembling the negative phases of the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability as a controlling atmospheric mechanism.",ENVIRON RES COMMUN,MAR,2020,10.1088/2515-7620/ab7ee9,Environmental Sciences,OC9WW,WOS:000579507900004
Climate crisis and flying: social media analysis traces the rise of flightshame,JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM,"Even before the global halt to extensive mobility due to the coronavirus crisis, there has been growing resistance amongst some groups to flying. Reflecting increasing concern about the imminent climate emergency, the phenomenon of feeling ashamed of flying and expressing related emotions through communication has resulted in the neologism flygskam. Drawing on 14,212 Twitter posts that contained flygskam and a further 1037 using the English flightshame, this research examined the spatial-temporal spread of these words from Sweden starting in 2016 to the rest of the world indicating a global phenomenon. The findings indicate that national context continues to be important in understanding the nexus of individual and social sensemaking and processing of new information. They also demonstrate, however, that global networks (facilitated through social media) might challenge the needs of physical mobility as requirements to connect, exchange views, and create identity through peer group membership. Further analysis of the content revealed key perspectives and topics, providing insight into the relatively homogeneous discussions amongst a network community. Only 6% of posts rejected the notion, whilst the majority indicated support and advanced suggestions for more sustainable alternatives. It might be too early to say whether language behaviour expressed in online communication translates into real behaviour, but the current pandemic may well provide further impetus to no-fly movements by way of a strategic alliance between different peer groups.",J SUSTAIN TOUR,SEP 2,2021,10.1080/09669582.2020.1851699,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",SE8US,WOS:000594048900001

Food for Hope: The Role of Personal Resources in Farmers' Adoption of Green Technology,SUSTAINABILITY,"Innovative technologies are expected to play a significant role in climate change mitigation and adaptation within the agriculture sector and in global food security. Clearly, however, the value of technological innovations in the agriculture sector is premised on their adoption. Therefore, understanding why farmers differ in their adoption of innovative green technologies is important. In the following paper, we review current literature and set the theoretical framework for suggesting that three important personal resources correlate with agricultural technology adoption: positive emotions, character strengths (including specific ones), and cognitive goal-oriented hope. This study constitutes an important theoretical basis for future practical recommendations for environmental policy, positive psychology, and innovation adoption that may help narrow some of the gaps in technology adoption rates. In addition to its theoretical innovation, the importance of this study lies in its practical value: we focus on variables that are influenced through policy, education, and communication. The theoretical connections between positive psychology and environmental studies emerging from this study should be developed and explored. We hope that this new perspective will motivate future research on these factors within diverse farming communities across different nations.",SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,MAY,2018,10.3390/su10051615,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,GJ7RP,WOS:000435587100311
Understanding the Communication of Climate Change Risk: Climate Scientists' Perspectives of Media Sources and Policy Makers,RISK HAZARDS & CRISIS IN PUBLIC POLICY,"Despite the volumes of research that climate scientists produce examining the causes, effects, and history of global climate change, there continues to be an acceptance gap between these scientists and the public and government officials. While climate scientists share a consensus that climate change is occurring and is primarily caused by human activity, many citizens and public officials remain skeptical about climate change. One cause of this gap could be the nature of scientists' communications of their work to the media, the public, and decision makers within the government. We conducted a survey of climate scientists to find out how they view this gap, its causes, and potential solutions. We focus our analysis on the scientists' assessments of three intervening factors - knowledge, media relations, and trust.",RISK HAZARDS CRISIS,DEC,2014,10.1002/rhc3.12066,Public Administration,V4S0C,WOS:000219209700001
The macroeconomic effects of adapting to high-end sea-level rise via protection and migration,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"Climate change-induced sea level rise (SLR) is projected to be substantial, triggering human adaptation responses, including increasing protection and out-migration from coastlines. Yet, in macroeconomic assessments of SLR the latter option has been given little attention. We fill this gap by providing a global analysis of the macroeconomic effects of adaptation to SLR, including coastal migration, focusing on the higher end of SLR projections until 2050. We find that when adapting simultaneously via protection and coastal migration, macroeconomic costs can be lower than with protection alone. For some developing regions coastal migration is even less costly (in GDP) than protection. Additionally, we find that future macroeconomic costs are dominated by accumulated macroeconomic effects over time, rather than by future direct damages, implying the need for immediate adaptation. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of including autonomous adaptation in the reference scenario of economic assessment studies to avoid overestimation of adaptation benefits. The authors calculated the economy-wide costs of sea level rise and possible adaptation options. Protection clearly pays off and when combining protection and coastal migration, costs can be brought down further, yet, residual damage costs are large.",NAT COMMUN,SEP 29,2022,10.1038/s41467-022-33043-z,Multidisciplinary Sciences,4Z2SM,WOS:000862065400030
Scaling just transitions: Legitimation strategies in coal phase-out commissions in Canada and Germany,POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY,"Climate change mitigation triggers both spatial and moral complexities, as demonstrated by the contentious issue of phasing out coal power. The success of the Paris Agreement depends on, among other things, the acceptability of climate policy measures and thus, from a moral perspective, on the ability to organize transition processes in ways that do not damage the livelihoods of workers, communities, and entire regions. Spatially, the unequal distributions of burdens and advantages of both climate change and respective mitigation measures provoke struggles over their legitimacy in contexts ranging from local to global. Phasing out coal mining and the respective power generation capacity thus triggers processes of structural transformation that cut across geographic scales, vertical levels of policy and politics, as well as sectoral boundaries. In light of the urgency of the climate crisis, countries such as Canada and Germany have established stakeholder-driven commissions to develop proposals for just transition pathways for phasing out coal production and consumption. We argue that these commissions are arenas in which spatial, moral, and sectoral (re-) negotiations materialize. Comparing the Canadian and German stakeholder commissions through expert interviews with their members, the article traces how governments use commissions to legitimize their transition policies. Expectations at different levels and from different actors in turn place commission members under pressure to justify their involvement and the outputs of the commissions. We find that the Canadian task force showed greater commitment to collecting and reflecting the needs of communities in its coal regions, and to communicating these to the federal government. In the German coal commission, legitimation strategies focused mainly on a broad representation of interests, and on government spending for affected regions, workers, and industries. In that case, a compromise was reached that satisfied most, but not all, of the diverse requirements.",POLIT GEOGR,JUN,2021,10.1016/j.polgeo.2021.102406,Geography; Political Science,SU2VZ,WOS:000663001300004
Consumers and technology in a changing world: the perspective from subsistence marketplaces,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide a perspective on consumers and technology in a changing world using insights gained from subsistence marketplaces. Consumers in a changing world are on different parts of the economic spectrum and are also reflected in contexts of poverty that is termed subsistence marketplaces. Data comes from pioneering the subsistence marketplaces stream of research, education and social enterprise. Design/methodology/approach The authors study the intersection of poverty and marketplaces, beginning at the micro-level, and take a bottom-up approach to deriving implications. Findings The authors cover both aspects - what micro-level insights about thinking, feeling and coping mean for technology perceptions and usage in general and what specific insights are derived for designing and implementing solutions that have bearing on the use of technology. In the course of all endeavors in research, education and social enterprise, technology, particularly information and communications technology, has been central. Research limitations/implications - The authors discuss implications for research at the confluence of a variety of uncertainties inherent in the context of subsistence marketplaces, in environmental issues and climate change and in the nature and speed of technological change and progress. Practical implications - In this paper, the authors discuss what subsistence marketplaces mean for consumers and technology in a changing world, lessons learned for the design and development of technological solutions, technological innovation from subsistence marketplaces and a broader discussion of the importance of bottom-up approaches to the intersection of subsistence marketplaces and technological solutions. Originality/value The authors use insights developed from pioneering the arena of subsistence marketplaces and creating synergies between research, education and social enterprise.",EUR J MARKETING,JUN 10,2019,10.1108/EJM-11-2017-0826,Business,IK3QF,WOS:000476502800010
The Role of Indigenous and Traditional Knowledge in Ecosystem-Based Adaptation: A Review of the Literature and Case Studies from the Pacific Islands,WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY,"Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) is increasingly being advocated as a climate adaptation approach that can deliver multiple benefits to communities. EbA scholarship argues that community-based projects can strengthen those ecosystems that deliver critical services to communities and in doing so enhance community resilience. In particular, the inclusion of indigenous and traditional knowledge (ITK) into community-based EbA projects is positioned as critical to successful climate adaptation. Yet, there is surprisingly little investigation into how ITK is being defined and incorporated into EbA initiatives. This paper critically reviews EbA literature and provides empirical examples from Vanuatu and Samoa to demonstrate the different ways ITK relates to EbA projects. We find that there is widespread recognition that ITK is important for indigenous and local communities and can be employed successfully in EbA. However, this recognition is more aspirational than practical and is not being necessarily translated into ITK-informed or ITK-driven EbA projects. ITK should not be conceptualized simply as a collection of local environmental information that is integrated with Western scientific knowledge. Instead, ITK is part of nested knowledge systems (information-practices-worldviews) of indigenous peoples. This knowledge includes local natural resource management, sociocultural governance structures, social norms, spiritual beliefs, and historical and contemporary experiences of colonial dispossession and marginalization. At present, most EbA projects focus on the provision of information to main decision-makers only; however, since ITK is held collectively, it is essential that entire communities are included in ITK EbA projects. There is a huge potential for researchers and ITK holders to coproduce knowledge that would be best placed to drive climate adaptation in a changing world.",WEATHER CLIM SOC,OCT,2018,10.1175/WCAS-D-18-0032.1,Environmental Studies; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,GW3QM,WOS:000446821400001

Instead, they may backfire for conservatives, less-efficacious people, and people who are low in proenvironmental values.

Black shales and other sediments with high organic matter contents in Phanerozoic climatic cycles: Communication 1. Black shales at the Gondwanan stage of biosphere evolution,LITHOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES,"The terminal Neoproterozoic was marked by the formation of a supercontinent, which was located during a long period at high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere. The supercontinent named Gondwana united present-day Africa, Australia, Antarctica, South America, Arabia, Hindustan, and several other small continental blocks. It was separated from other, smaller continental blocks by ocean basins with the thinned continental and oceanic crust with the Panthalassa Ocean being largest among them. The Gondwanan stage, which comprised the Vendian and significant part of the Paleozoic, was one of the longest stages defined in the Neoproterozoic and Phanerozoic geological history lasting over 300-330 Ma. During this stage, the continental sector of the Earth's crust included the Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia, Kazakhstan, and North China (Tarim) blocks, in addition to Gondwana, which were largely located at low latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. In the Early Paleozoic, main tectonic events were related to the breakup in peripheral parts of Gondwana with the separation of small continental massifs, which moved in the northerly direction. Their collision with other continents was accompanied by the folding and formation of mountainous structures with corresponding foredeeps. For example, the Taconian phase of fold-thrust deformations resulted from the convergence of Laurentia with the Avalon block, which was separated from the northern margin of Gondwana in the Late Cambrian or Early Ordovician. The movement of Gondwana toward the equator and its amalgamation with other continents and smaller continental blocks in the terminal Cambrian resulted in the formation of the Pangea supercontinent, whose location near the equator for more than 150 Ma up to its disintegration at the terminal Jurassic-initial Cretaceous transition was responsible for significant global changes in the floral and faunal communities. Paleozoic epochs of the relatively stable warm climate alternated with shorter periods, which were characterized by global cooling due to expansion of the ice sheet in Gondwana. These periods are reflected in frequent migrations of climatic belts and rapid sea level oscillations, which were accompanied by changes in boundaries of facies zones and extinctions of biotic communities. Distribution patterns of black shales and other organic-rich sediments in sections imply cyclic climatic variations during the entire Paleozoic. Duration of individual cycles, which included a long phase of the dominant warm or even hot climate and shorter cooling phase crowning the cycle, was as long as 47 Ma. Two such cycles terminated with glaciations; others, with a less significant growth of the Gondwanan ice sheet.",LITHOL MINER RESOUR+,SEP,2015,10.1134/S0024490215050041,Geochemistry & Geophysics; Geology; Mineralogy,CP9SI,WOS:000360234400003

Warming and nitrogen deposition lessen microbial residue contribution to soil carbon pool,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"Microorganisms have a role as gatekeepers for terrestrial carbon fluxes, either causing its release to the atmosphere through their decomposition activities or preventing its release by stabilizing the carbon in a form that cannot be easily decomposed. Although research has focused on microbial sources of greenhouse gas production, somewhat limited attention has been paid to the microbial role in carbon sequestration. However, increasing numbers of reports indicate the importance of incorporating microbial-derived carbon into soil stable carbon pools. Here we investigate microbial residues in a California annual grassland after a continuous 9-year manipulation of three environmental factors (elevated CO2, warming and nitrogen deposition), singly and in combination. Our results indicate that warming and nitrogen deposition can both alter the fraction of carbon derived from microbes in soils, though for two very different reasons. A reduction in microbial carbon contribution to stable carbon pools may have implications for our predictions of global change impacts on soil stored carbon.",NAT COMMUN,NOV,2012,10.1038/ncomms2224,Multidisciplinary Sciences,104KP,WOS:000315992100057
Who cares about climate change? The mass media and socio-political acceptance of Canada's oil sands and Northern Gateway Pipeline,ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE,"Canada's proposed Northern Gateway Pipeline would carry unrefined bitumen from the Alberta oil sands to the coast of British Columbia for international export. Socio-political acceptance or opposition can determine the fate of such projects, and media coverage offers insight into public discourse, including how the project is framed. We analyzed print media coverage of the project in six Canadian newspapers, including 2097 articles published from 2008 to 2014. The objectives were threefold: 1) to characterize media framing of the project using a risk/benefit framework; 2) to identify regional differences in framing between the two affected provinces; and 3) to investigate the framing of environmental risk. Our findings demonstrate that public debate is dominated by environmental risk of the project with a tendency to frame the project as a trade-off between economic benefit and environment risk. Despite a strongly regional distribution of risks and benefits, we did not find substantial differences in framing between newspapers in the two affected provinces. Finally we found that the environmental risk frame was presented predominately according to potential local impacts due to pipeline or tanker rupture.

Strong phenotypic plasticity limits potential for evolutionary responses to climate change,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"Phenotypic plasticity, the expression of multiple phenotypes from one genome, is a wide-spread adaptation to short-term environmental fluctuations, but whether it facilitates evolutionary adaptation to climate change remains contentious. Here, we investigate seasonal plasticity and adaptive potential in an Afrotropical butterfly expressing distinct phenotypes in dry and wet seasons. We assess the transcriptional architecture of plasticity in a full-factorial analysis of heritable and environmental effects across 72 individuals, and reveal pervasive gene expression differences between the seasonal phenotypes. Strikingly, intra-population genetic variation for plasticity is largely absent, consistent with specialisation to a particular environmental cue reliably predicting seasonal transitions. Under climate change, deteriorating accuracy of predictive cues will likely aggravate maladaptive phenotype-environment mismatches and increase selective pressures on reaction norms. However, the observed paucity of genetic variation for plasticity limits evolutionary responses, potentially weakening prospects for population persistence. Thus, seasonally plastic species may be especially vulnerable to climate change.",NAT COMMUN,MAR 8,2018,10.1038/s41467-018-03384-9,Multidisciplinary Sciences,FY6YB,WOS:000427007700014
Popular culture and the new human condition: Catastrophe narratives and climate change,GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE,"Striking popular culture images of burnt landscapes, tidal waves and ice-bound cities have the potential to dramatically and emotively convey the dangers of climate change. Given that a significant number of people derive a substantial proportion of their information on the threat of climate change, or the new human condition, from popular culture works such as catastrophe movies, it is important that an investigation into the nature of the representations produced be embedded in the attempt to address the issue. What climate change-related messages may be encoded in popular films, television and novels, how are they being received, and what effects may they have? This article adopts the cultural studies perspective that popular culture gives us an important means by which to access the structures of feeling that characterise a society at a particular historic juncture: the views held and emotional states experienced by significant amounts of people as evident in disparate forms of cultural production. It further adopts the related viewpoint that popular culture has an effect upon the society in which it is consumed, as well as reflecting that society's desires and concerns although the nature of the effect may be difficult to quantify. From this position, the article puts forward a theory on the role of ecological catastrophe narratives in current popular culture, before going on to review existing critical work on ecologically-charged popular films and novels which attempts to assess their effects on their audiences. It also suggests areas for future research, such as the prevalent but little studied theme of natural and environmental disaster in late-Victorian science fiction writing. This latter area is of interest because it reveals the emergence of an ecological awareness or structure of feeling as early as the late-nineteenth century, and allows the relationship of this development to environmental policy making to be investigated because of the historical timeframe. Effectively communicating the threat of climate change and the need to address it, reframing the perspective from a detached and scientifically-articulated problem to one of a human condition immediate and personal is on one level a task of narrative, or story-telling, and cultural studies has an important role to play in this and in elucidating the challenges involved. In line with the remit of the special issue in which this article appears, it is written as a review article specifically addressing the question of what cultural studies can contribute to helping to articulate the 'new human condition' of existence under climate change. As such, it offers some initial preliminary readings of popular culture trends, outlines a potential methodology, briefly summarises some effective work already done in the area and suggests further potential avenues of enquiry.

THz Channel Sounding and Modeling Techniques: An Overview,IEEE ACCESS,"As the world warms up to the idea of millimeter wave (mmWave) communication and fifth generation (5G) mobile networks, realization slowly dawns that the data rate, latency, throughput, and other performance metrics that are used to assess a new wireless communication technology will not be enough to support the demands of envisioned futuristic applications. Thus there is an eagerness to further climb up the frequency ladder to use the large swathes of available spectrum in the 0.1 - 10 THz band which is expected to act as the key technology enabler to fulfill the requirements of the sixth generation (6G) wireless communication and possibly even beyond. Channel measurement and modeling are crucial to the design and deployment of future wireless communication systems and researchers across the globe are putting their best foot forward to accelerate the process. The current article presents comprehensive assimilation of research efforts in the context of THz channel sounding. A detailed overview of the current channel sounding techniques is first introduced followed by their relevance to THz band channel measurement. An in-house novel channel sounder developed for THz band measurement is also briefly introduced in this context. The paper next provides elaborate dissemination of various measurement campaigns in the band of interest followed by the modeling techniques that are available in the literature and are being adopted for the THz band. Post the description of different challenges and future research directions in the context of sounding, measurement, and modeling the article is concluded.",IEEE ACCESS,NA,2023,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3246161,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",9R0ZF,WOS:000945384200001
"Comparisons of simulated radiation, surface wind stress and SST fields over tropical pacific by the GISS CMIP6 versions of global climate models with observations",ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS,"This study compares the overall performance between versions 2.1 and 3 of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) global climate models (referred to as GISS-E2.1 and GISS-E3, respectively), in simulating the present-day Pacific climate using the CMIP6 protocol. Model physical representations and configurations are extensively changed from GISS-E2.1 to GISS-E3, which result in greatly reduced discrepancies, including ice water path (IWP), ice water content (IWC), radiative fluxes, surface wind stress (TAU), sea surface temperature (SST), precipitation (PR) and column water vapor (PRW), relative to satellite-based observational products over south Pacific oceans. Cloud only IWP (CIWP) shows the largest change, decreasing biases from similar to 400 g kg(-1) in GISS-E2.1 to 10-20 g kg(-1) in GISS-E3. The combination of improved CIWP and the inclusion of snow in GISS-E3 may play roles on reducing overestimated outgoing longwave radiation, overestimated reflected shortwave at the top of atmosphere, and underestimated surface downward shortwave in GISS-E2.1. Both models' intertropical convergence zones (ITCZs) are, however, located far too north of the equator, as found in radiative fluxes, PR and PRW but not in SST relative to observations. This introduces biases in TAU, PR and PRW over north flank of the equator and north Pacific. Over south Pacific, especially the trade wind regions, the improvements of radiation fluxes, SST, PR and PRW appear to be due to improved TAU associated with inclusion of snow-radiative effects. In particular, GISS-E3 reduces a longstanding too warm SST bias over trade-wind regions, from 4 K in GISS-E2.1 to within 0.5 K, and too cold SST bias over north Pacific Ocean. Although GISS-E3 shows improved geographic patterns of the simulated fields in particular over south Pacific oceans compared to GISS-E2.1, our results suggest that the location of ITCZ needs to be further improved.",ENVIRON RES COMMUN,JAN 1,2023,10.1088/2515-7620/aca9ab,Environmental Sciences,8S2GQ,WOS:000928402900001
Adaptation of a Traditional Irrigation System of Micro-Plots to Smart Agri Development: A Case Study in Murcia (Spain),AGRONOMY-BASEL,"Currently, water users associations (WUAs) in semi-arid areas of southeastern Spain (Murcia region) send a multitude of data supplied by sensors in the field to the cloud. The constant technological revolution offers opportunities for small farms not to be abandoned, thanks to the Internet of Things (IoT). This technology allows them to continue to manage remotely using smartphones/tablets/laptops. This new system contributes to the mitigation of climate change from several aspects: reduction of water footprint and energy consumption (in the pumps that pressurize the grid, such as in the optimization of the proposed solution, by using batteries that communicate in low radiation of electric and magnetic alternating fields (LoRad), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), or narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), or clean energy). The analysis of these data and the incorporation of new IoT technologies facilitate the maintenance of green roofs and ensure the continuity of these farms. The direct benefit obtained is remarkable CO(2)removal that prevents desertification by the abandonment of arable land. This communication shows the implementation of a Smart Agri system in areas with micro-plots (surface less than 0.5 ha) with low-cost technology based on long-range (LoRa) systems, easily maintainable by personnel with basic knowledge of automation, which transforms into a very interesting solution for regions with development roads. In addition, complex orography and difficult access are added in both physical and technological environments. The main technical limitations found in such plots are poor coverage for mobile phones and unworkable and expensive implementation by wiring or WiFi/radio systems. Currently, thanks to the Smart Agri system implemented in this WUA in Murcia, farmers can manage and control the irrigation systems in their plots from home. Then, they cannot lose their crops and respect the isolation conditions imposed by the Spanish government as a result of the alarm caused by COVID-19.",AGRONOMY-BASEL,SEP,2020,10.3390/agronomy10091365,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,OD8XV,WOS:000580130300001
Performance of Real-Time Geospatial Spectrum Sharing (RGSS) between 5G Communication Networks and Earth Exploration Satellite Services,2021 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DYNAMIC SPECTRUM ACCESS NETWORKS (DYSPAN),"A proof of concept system that enables real-time geospatial spectrum sharing between 5G/6G networks and Earth Exploration Satellite Services (EESS) has been developed. A simple algorithm that pauses network transmissions when there is potential interference from 5G/6G transmitters provides 99.6% network availability in the 24 GHz NR2 band while protecting all currently working EESS radiometers operating in the 23.8 GHz band. A more sophisticated algorithm that modifies transmission power levels and (if necessary) network traffic (similar to the methodologies used by Citizens Broadband Radio Service) can reduce interference so that there is no adverse impact on network availability. In addition to preventing interference, RGSS provides other significant benefits to both the wireless and the weather/climate communities, including improving network performance and coverage, the ability to support changes in network architectures, network elements, endpoints, and new or more sensitive radiometers, and a simple mechanism to test and police compliance with out-of-band emission requirements. RGSS is also compatible with existing spectrum management systems.",IEEE INT SYMP DYNAM,NA,2021,10.1109/DySPAN53946.2021.9677268,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Telecommunications",BS9CK,WOS:000779168000012
Survey and Performance Comparison of AMR Over PLC Standards,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY,"Automatic meter reading (AMR) is an application implemented by power utilities which is becoming increasingly important in the utilities sector. It could be included in the more general environment of demand side management, which satisfies the need for more improved communications. AMR offers a better financial return due to the inclusion of other applications. Although there are several international standards which address AMR, most deployments are currently using proprietary systems. This fact may reflect that current standards do not fully cover this area. Since the power network reaches all energy meters, a convenient way to deploy AMR is to use the power lines as a transmission medium. The present-day situation is that there is mounting pressure to deploy AMR systems in a bid to provide better management of the energy demand in a bid to reduce global warming and create a more sustainable electrical system in our environmentally conscious society. This paper is focused on analyzing different standards and specifications related to AMR over powerline communications (PLC). Furthermore, two of them are chosen, implemented, and simulated using the OPNET modeler. The main goal of the implemented applications is to obtain comparative results of the two most known standard applications in AMR over PLC.",IEEE T POWER DELIVER,APR,2009,10.1109/TPWRD.2008.2002845,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",431VS,WOS:000265093000014
The relative role of the subsurface Southern Ocean in driving negative Antarctic Sea ice extent anomalies in 2016-2021,COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT,"The low Antarctic sea ice extent following its dramatic decline in late 2016 has persisted over a multiyear period. However, it remains unclear to what extent this low sea ice extent can be attributed to changing ocean conditions. Here, we investigate the causes of this period of low Antarctic sea ice extent using a coupled climate model partially constrained by observations. We find that the subsurface Southern Ocean played a smaller role than the atmosphere in the extreme sea ice extent low in 2016, but was critical for the persistence of negative anomalies over 2016-2021. Prior to 2016, the subsurface Southern Ocean warmed in response to enhanced westerly winds. Decadal hindcasts show that subsurface warming has persisted and gradually destabilized the ocean from below, reducing sea ice extent over several years. The simultaneous variations in the atmosphere and ocean after 2016 have further amplified the decline in Antarctic sea ice extent.",COMMUN EARTH ENVIRON,NOV 30,2022,10.1038/s43247-022-00624-1,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",6S4WZ,WOS:000892990700001
Evaluating the climate SWOT as a tool for defining climate strategies for business,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,"Climate change is often referred to as the next major force shaping the business environment in which companies operate. This study aims at contributing to the needs of businesses for quicker and cost-efficient ways to strategically plan for the future uncertainty of climate change. When structuring the intertextual field around the underlying study, there are two main fields of contribution: (1) the systematical approach to the complex uncertainty related to climate change and its communication from a strategic perspective; and (2) developing novel approaches to life-cycle-based methodologies. The study includes the life-cycle perspective through a new, simplified method of representing product-related climate information in the form of an improved SWOT (i.e. Climate SWOT). We approach the climate-related structural change of the business environment by addressing questions of how usable the Climate SWOT is in building climate strategies; whether or not it raises awareness of the life-cycle perspective and climate change strategies and if it is able to produce strategic or operational changes in the pilot organizations. The focus of this research is therefore not the introduction of the tool itself, but rather the evaluation of the tool, as perceived by the users. Data were collected via surveys targeted at two principal focus groups: users of the tool (analysts), in May 2011; and users of the results (decision-makers), in September 2011. The results were positive in terms that the tool was implemented and seen as useful; it raised awareness both about climate issues and the life-cycle perspective and helped in communicating product-specific strategies to a wider audience; and it facilitated concrete changes. The findings resulted in further refinement of the tool to improve its usability. All in all, the Climate SWOT was indeed seen as helpful in structuring the situation around climate change and to develop strategies. In terms of raising awareness, a significant behavioral trigger, the Climate SWOT was perceived by the respondents to offer a concrete tool to become aware of climate change, in order to relate their activities to the phenomenon and incorporate its opportunities and threats into long-term strategic planning. The second survey was able to confirm that concrete operative or strategic changes had occurred in 50% of the cases. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

National level organisational responses to climate change adaptation: a case study of Malawi,CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT,"Climate change is presenting new and, to a large extent, unpredictable challenges to communities in Malawi and effective adaptation requires a well-coordinated organisational framework. This study looked at the success of organisations and the processes they employed for implementing policies that have implications for climate change adaptation in Malawi. This was done by assessing the linkages between different interest groups, as well as potential conflicts of interest between actors from the national to the local level. One of the major findings was that although national organisational and policy interventions seem to be well linked among various actors, community needs are mostly compromised. There is no effective communication between adaptation strategies which are proposed and the livelihood strategies in communities within the country. Local knowledge is given very little attention in formulating, communicating and implementing policies that have implications for adaptation to climate change. The study highlights inadequate human and financial resources to support climate change adaptation in Malawi. It also exposes the weak links between different stakeholders and the subsequent lack of collective commitment. Results suggest that there is a lot of talk about climate change adaptation strategies but the actual implementation needs improvement.",CLIM DEV,JAN 1,2013,10.1080/17565529.2013.763762,Development Studies; Environmental Studies,121WE,WOS:000317274700008
Impact of ocean acidification on marine ecosystems: educational challenges and innovations,MARINE BIOLOGY,"Population growth and social/technological developments have resulted in the buildup of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere and oceans to the extent that we now see changes in the earth's climate and ocean chemistry. Ocean acidification is one consequence of these changes, and it is known with certainty that it will continue to increase as we emit more CO2 into the atmosphere. Ocean acidification is a global issue likely to impact marine organisms, food webs and ecosystems and to be most severely experienced by the people who depend on the goods and services the ocean provides at regional and local levels. However, research is in its infancy and the available data on biological impacts are complex (e.g., species-specific response). Educating future generations on the certainties and uncertainties of the emerging science of ocean acidification and its complex consequences for marine species and ecosystems can provide insights that will help assessing the need to mitigate and/or adapt to future global change. This article aims to present different educational approaches, the different material available and highlight the future challenges of ocean acidification education for both educators and marine biologists.",MAR BIOL,AUG,2013,10.1007/s00227-012-1943-4,Marine & Freshwater Biology,200KB,WOS:000323066600009
Public Health Literacy Defined,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE,"Public health literacy is an emerging concept necessary to understand and address the broad array of factors, such as climate change, globalization, and poverty, that influence the public's health. Whereas health literacy has traditionally been operationalized as an individual-level construct, public health literacy takes into account the complex social, ecologic, and systemic forces affecting health and well-being. However, public health literacy has not yet been fully articulated. This paper addresses this gap by outlining a broad, new definition of public health literacy. This definition was developed through an inductive analytic process conducted in 2007 by a multidisciplinary research team, and two expert-panel sessions were convened to assess the consensual validity of the emergent definition. Based on this process, public health literacy is defined as the degree to which individuals and groups can obtain, process, understand, evaluate, and act on information needed to make public health decisions that benefit the community. Three dimensions of public health literacy-conceptual foundations, critical skills, and civic orientation-and related competencies are also proposed. Public health literacy is distinct from individual-level health literacy, and together, the two types of literacy form a more comprehensive model of health literacy. A five-part agenda is offered for future research and action aimed at increasing levels of public health literacy.

Fear Appeals and College Students' Attitudes and Behavioral Intentions Toward Global Warming,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION,"This study used Witte's extended parallel process model to examine the relationships between the use of fear appeals and college students' attitudes and behavioral intentions toward global warming. A pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design was adopted. Three hundred forty-one college students from six communication courses at two universities were recruited for this experiment. The results show that when in a high-threat condition, both high-and low-efficacy messages resulted in positive attitudes and behavioral changes, while in a low-threat condition, low-efficacy messages led to negative changes in attitudes and behavioral intentions. This study suggests that when attempting to promote low carbon-emitting behaviors among college students, messages should contain both threat and efficacy information, but messages that contain low-threat and low-efficacy information should be avoided.",J ENVIRON EDUC,NA,2014,10.1080/00958964.2014.930399,Education & Educational Research; Environmental Studies,AO2HU,WOS:000341140900003

Dipole patterns in tropical precipitation were pervasive across landmasses throughout Marine Isotope Stage 5,COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT,"Most of Earth's rain falls in the tropics, often in highly seasonal monsoon rains, which are thought to be coupled to the inter-hemispheric migrations of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone in response to the seasonal cycle of insolation. Yet characterization of tropical rainfall behaviour in the geologic past is poor. Here we combine new and existing hydroclimate records from six large-scale tropical regions with fully independent model-based rainfall reconstructions across the last interval of sustained warmth and ensuing climate cooling between 130 to 70 thousand years ago (Marine Isotope Stage 5). Our data-model approach reveals large-scale heterogeneous rainfall patterns in response to changes in climate. We note pervasive dipole-like tropical precipitation patterns, as well as different loci of precipitation throughout Marine Isotope Stage 5 than recorded in the Holocene. These rainfall patterns cannot be solely attributed to meridional shifts in the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone. Tropical rainfall patterns varied throughout Marine Isotope Stage 5, beyond the influence of meridional shifts in the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone, suggest analyses of tropical hydroclimate proxy records and model-based precipitation reconstructions.",COMMUN EARTH ENVIRON,MAR 19,2021,10.1038/s43247-021-00133-7,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",SY3CO,WOS:000665768900005
Communication in Crisis Situations in the Process of Immunization,COLLEGIUM ANTROPOLOGICUM,"Immunization is one of the most effective medical interventions in the prevention of the disease and represents the easiest and most cost-effective investment in health. The strategy of controlling contagious diseases that can be prevented through immunization has a long tradition in B&H. Mandatory immunizations are administered against ten diseases. Although the development of new technologies, the efforts of the pharmaceutical industry, the development of new vaccines provides better vaccines in terms of greater safety and effectiveness it should be pointed out that no vaccine is absolutely effective and safe, and it will not achieve the immune response in 100% vaccinated, also there are possible side effects and unexpected reactions that could occur. Vaccination is often a media issue because previously unnoticed local, isolated events-side effects and complications of vaccination are now accompanied by media attention as there are now numerous and fast communication channels (internet, e-mail, TV, etc.) and media evolved from being less controlled to more commercial Doubt in benefit of vaccination is growing even among health professionals who are expected to provide up-to-date, understandable information, and issue information about immunization benefits and potential risks. It is therefore important for health professionals to be well informed, to be a good source of authoritative, scientific and reasonable advice, and to speak openly about the benefits and risks of vaccination so that consumers fully understand both possible outcomes of vaccination. This takes communication skills, particularly in crisis situations connected with vaccination. Health professionals are thus faced with a changing attitude toward importance of immunization in the social climate where risk is less tolerated than ever before.",COLLEGIUM ANTROPOL,SEP,2012,NA,Anthropology,031TB,WOS:000310664100052
Communicating Climate Change to a Local but Diverse Audience: On the Positive Impact of Locality Framing,ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNICATION-A JOURNAL OF NATURE AND CULTURE,"This study investigates the impact of locality framing in infographics about sea level rise as a consequence of anthropogenic climate change (ACC).

Developing a CCS communication framework for Japan,GHGT-11,"The project Developing a CCS communication framework for Japan aims to test a prototype Knowledge Management System (KMS) on a pilot scale, with a view to more broadly utilizing the methodology in an international context. For this purpose, an on-line community was formed, involving CCS experts (10 to 15) from major Japanese CCS-related organizations. The Global (ITS Institute provided its digital platform to facilitate communication between members of the community. One of the toolkits, an argumentation model, is developed to support structured and effective knowledge sharing. Arguments, evidence and criticisms that were identified through on-line discussion were structured in a hierarchy to form an argumentation model that overviews the justification for the claim that CCS is an effective measure to mitigate global warming in general and its effects on Japan in particular. The argumentation model provides a useful overview of arguments relating to CCS with explanation of background knowledge, supported by linked evidence and quantitative data.

Effects of Communication Network Performance on Dynamic Pricing in Smart Power Grid,IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL,"In our fight against global warming and excessive carbon emission, smart power grid has emerged as a useful tool for its ability to integrate renewable energy sources with traditional energy sources in a single distribution system. Smart power grid depends on consumption scheduling and dynamic pricing to match power supply and demand, and to avoid significant fluctuation in power load. A supply demand mismatch or a large deviation in the power load may cause power outage and damage to equipments. In the literature, various dynamic pricing schemes have been proposed to manage and control power load. However, these existing works often assume perfect communication network performance, where pricing information and control messages can be transmitted to remote users without delay and without transmission error. In practice, communication channel is error prone and network delay is not negligible. In view of the situation, this paper begins by studying the effects of network delay and transmission error on achieving a desired power load through dynamic pricing. We find that these communication network impairments may impose a lower bound on price update interval, and an upper bound on price update step size. Based on the findings, we further propose a heuristics algorithm to determine the price update interval and price update step size, for a given requirement of maximum deviation in power load from a desired level. We have evaluated the proposed algorithm through random event simulations. Evaluation results confirm that, in the presence of network delay and transmission error, deviation from the desired power load can be limited for a range of number of users and price sensitivity of users.",IEEE SYST J,JUN,2014,10.1109/JSYST.2013.2260913,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Operations Research & Management Science; Telecommunications",AI8IH,WOS:000337155400021
"Visualizing changes to US federal environmental agency websites, 2016-2020",PLOS ONE,"Websites have become the primary means by which the US federal government communicates about its operations and presents information for public consumption. However, the alteration or removal of critical information from these sites is often entirely legal and done without the public's awareness. Relative to paper records, websites enable governments to shape public understanding in quick, scalable, and permissible ways. During the Trump administration, website changes indicative of climate denial prompted civil society organizations to develop tools for tracking online government information sources. We in the Environmental Data & Governance Initiative (EDGI) illustrate how five data visualization techniques can be used to document and analyze changes to government websites. We examine a large sample of websites of US federal environmental agencies and show that between 2016 and 2020: 1) the use of the term climate change decreased by an estimated 38%; 2) access to as much as 20% of the Environmental Protection Agency's website was removed; 3) changes were made more to Cabinet agencies' websites and to highly visible pages. In formulating ways to visualize and assess the alteration of websites, our study lays important groundwork for both systematically tracking changes and holding officials more accountable for their web practices. Our techniques enable researchers and watchdog groups alike to operate at the scale necessary to understand the breadth of impact an administration can have on the online face of government.",PLOS ONE,FEB 25,2021,10.1371/journal.pone.0246450,Multidisciplinary Sciences,QQ5BB,WOS:000624536800064

Role of perception in determining adaptive capacity: communities adapting to environmental change,SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE,"In this study, we investigate perception of likely environmental change as a factor of community adaptive capacity. A comparison of perceived change with science-based assessment of change is proposed to better understand community risk assessment and decision-making. Based on this analysis, we identify shared attitudes and perceptions of change that can be used to develop communication about environmental change in a manner that is appropriate within the context of the community. A community-level survey was conducted to sample differences in individual perception of likely environmental change as well as attitudes regarding climate change and natural resource management among residents of Alaska's Kenai Peninsula. We compare perceptions of likely environmental change to science-based assessments of change using a conceptual framework that recognizes socio-cognitive processes associated with decision-making. We evaluate the relationship of those perceptions to attitudes using quantitative methods. A binary logistic model is used to investigate the predictive relationship between perception and attitudes regarding climate change and natural resource management.

A Computer Game Environment to Encourage Collaborative Learning,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 4TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON GAMES BASED LEARNING,"Teaching a subject which involves a long process and inter-related problems can sometimes be difficult through conventional classroom activities. This is particularly difficult at the UK Key Stage 3 (13-14 years) where students are only beginning to understand the processes of reason. Often what the teacher would like to encourage is group discussion but for many reasons, young students may be reluctant to put forward ideas in a conventional classroom setting. An area where this becomes less of a problem is once they get involved in playing a game together. In addition to this certain subjects are difficult to teach because they involve complex interactions that are largely outside the general knowledge of young students. An example of this is the issue of human contributions to climate change. The subject is one of recent heated debate, much of which involves complex arguments on the relationship between the natural contribution to climate variation and those produced by human beings. In the work reported here a computer game has been developed which tries to incorporate the various processes involved in a realistic way. In principle this game can be used individually. However, it also provides the opportunity for generating group discussion and reasoning processes. The game which has been developed uses a non-player character which is controlled by the teacher. The game is played in a networked environment with a number of teams of two players each trying to provide solutions to a complex climate issue. The non player character is able to monitor the performance of the different teams and provide feedback that will be of a more realistic/less predictable nature. An empirical study and control based experiment have been done using this computer game to investigate the effectiveness of game-based learning towards tackling these issues. The initial study involved two groups of Key Stage 3 children in a Geography class. The study was undertaken in the normal teaching sequence. The children were divided into pairs during gameplay and each session lasted about one hour. The behaviour of the whole group and individual teams was monitored throughout the gameplay. Analysis of this shows that the game not only allowed the students to investigate the science but also to communicate with each other during the process. It is felt that by introducing an environment with which they were sufficiently familiar (playing a game together) the normal inhibitions to communication were removed. The control based experiment reinforced these findings.",NA,NA,2010,NA,Education & Educational Research,BBQ58,WOS:000307871500052
Modeling of crop wild relative species identifies areas globally for in situ conservation,COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY,"The impact of climate change is causing challenges for the agricultural production and food systems. More nutritious and climate resilient crop varieties are required, but lack of available and accessible trait diversity is limiting crop improvement. Crop wild relatives (CWR) are the wild cousins of cultivated crops and a vast resource of genetic diversity for breeding new, higher yielding, climate change tolerant crop varieties, but they are under-conserved (particularly in situ), largely unavailable and therefore underutilized. Here we apply species distribution modelling, climate change projections and geographic analyses to 1261 CWR species from 167 major crop genepools to explore key geographical areas for CWR in situ conservation worldwide. We identify 150 sites where 65.7% of the CWR species identified can be conserved for future use.",COMMUN BIOL,APR 23,2019,10.1038/s42003-019-0372-z,Biology; Multidisciplinary Sciences,HU6XQ,WOS:000465425700004
Experimental comparison of impact of auction format on carbon allowance market,RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS,"Carbon allowances auctions are a good way to achieve the carbon allowance allocations under international agreements to address global climate change. Based on an economic experiment, this paper compares three possible carbon allowance auction formats (uniform price auction, discriminatory price auction and English clock auction) with heterogeneous bidders (coal power plants and gas power plants) from four perspectives (carbon price, auction efficiency, demand withholding and fluctuations in power supplies). Possibilities of collusion among bidders and impacts of allowance banking and penalty price on bidders' behaviors under different auction formats are also examined. The results show that (1) when there are relatively more bidders and there are no obvious communications between them, despite there being some tacit collusion, efficiency of English clock auction is greater than the other two formats; (2) when there are relatively fewer bidders and there are obvious communications between them, explicit collusions are observed under English clock auction. In this case, discriminatory price auction helps prevent collusion to some extents; (3) in the banking scenario, more speculations are observed, while penalty price exacerbates price volatility.

"How to Deal with Heat Stress at an Open-Air Event? Exploring Visitors' Vulnerability, Risk Perception, and Adaptive Behavior with a Multimethod Approach",WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY,"Heat waves are increasingly common in many countries across the globe, and also in Germany, where this study is set. Heat poses severe health risks, especially for vulnerable groups such as the elderly and children. This case study explores visitors' behavior and perceptions during six weekends in the summer of 2018 at a 6-month open-air horticultural show. Data from a face-to-face survey (n = 306) and behavioral observations ( n = 2750) were examined by using correlation analyses, ANOVA, and multiple regression analyses. Differences in weather perception, risk awareness, adaptive behavior, and activity level were observed between rainy days (maximum daily temperature, 25 degrees C), warmsummer days (25 degrees-30 degrees C), and hot days (>30 degrees C). Respondents reported a high level of heat risk awareness, butmost (90%) were unaware of actual heat warnings. During hot days, more adaptive measures were reported and observed. Older respondents reported taking the highest number of adaptive measures. We observed the highest level of adaptation in children, but they also showed the highest activity level. From our results we discuss how to facilitate individual adaptation to heat stress at open-air events by taking the heterogeneity of visitors into account. To mitigate negative health outcomes for citizens in the future, we argue for tailored risk communication aimed at vulnerable groups. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: People around the world are facing higher average temperatures. While higher temperatures make open-air events a popular leisure time activity in summer, heat waves are a threat to health and life. Since there is not much research on how visitors of such events perceive different weather conditions-especially hot temperatures-we explored this in our case study in southern Germany at an open-air horticultural show in the summer of 2018. We discovered deficits both in people's awareness of current heat risk and the heat adaptation they carry out themselves. Future research should further investigate risk perception and adaptation behavior of private individuals, whereas event organizers and authorities need to continually focus on risk communication and facilitate individual adaptation of their visitors.",WEATHER CLIM SOC,OCT,2021,10.1175/WCAS-D-21-0027.1,Environmental Studies; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,YR4ZP,WOS:000750001100019
Intersectoral approaches: the key to mitigating psychosocial and health consequences of disasters and systemic risks,DISASTER PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT,"PurposeThe current pandemic and ongoing climate risks highlight the limited capacity of various systems, including health and social ones, to respond to population-scale and long-term threats. Practices to reduce the impacts on the health and well-being of populations must evolve from a reactive mode to preventive, proactive and concerted actions beginning at individual and community levels. Experiences and lessons learned from the pandemic will help to better prevent and reduce the psychosocial impacts of floods, or other hydroclimatic risks, in a climate change context.Design/methodology/approachThe present paper first describes the complexity and the challenges associated with climate change and systemic risks. It also presents some systemic frameworks of mental health determinants, and provides an overview of the different types of psychosocial impacts of disasters. Through various Quebec case studies and using lessons learned from past and recent flood-related events, recommendations are made on how to better integrate individual and community factors in disaster response.FindingsResults highlight the fact that people who have been affected by the events are significantly more likely to have mental health problems than those not exposed to flooding. They further demonstrate the adverse and long-term effects of floods on psychological health, notably stemming from indirect stressors at the community and institutional levels. Different strategies are proposed from individual-centered to systemic approaches, in putting forward the advantages from intersectoral and multirisk researches and interventions.Originality/valueThe establishment of an intersectoral flood network, namely the InterSectoral Flood Network of Quebec (RIISQ), is presented as an interesting avenue to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and a systemic view of flood risks. Intersectoral work is proving to be a major issue in the management of systemic risks, and should concern communities, health and mental health professionals, and the various levels of governance. As climate change is called upon to lead to more and more systemic risks, close collaboration between all the areas concerned with the management of the factors of vulnerability and exposure of populations will be necessary to respond effectively to damages and impacts (direct and indirect) linked to new meteorological and compound hazards. This means as well to better integrate the communication managers into the risk management team.",DISASTER PREV MANAG,2022 DEC 15,2022,10.1108/DPM-09-2022-0190,"Environmental Studies; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Management",6Z6XS,WOS:000897917700001
Informing about the invisible: communicating en route air pollution and noise exposure to cyclists and pedestrians using focus groups,EUROPEAN TRANSPORT RESEARCH REVIEW,"Active mobility and public transport are considered beneficial for health and wellbeing and valuable for climate change mitigation. However, cyclists and pedestrians have high air pollution and noise exposure alongside traffic, which adversely impact health and wellbeing. The measured exposure can differ from the perceived exposure, hence, communicating en route exposure is crucial. Therefore, this study investigates how to communicate route-based exposure to cyclists and pedestrians and explores if exposure communication, e.g. via smartphones, is worthwhile for healthy and pleasant commute. It is investigated how exposure feedback influences the motivation to protect oneself and how exposure information should be designed. Three focus groups with 20 cyclists/pedestrians living in Berlin, Germany, were conducted. Based on Protection Motivation Theory and Environmental Health Literacy concept, (1) experiences and practices after recognizing exposure were discussed and (2) information needs and communication strategies were developed. The results reveal a feeling of helplessness regarding the ubiquity and uncertainty of pollution and a heightened threat appraisal. Anger, anxiety and rejection were stated. Making sense of pollution levels and protective alternatives were central. A healthy routing app, including also pleasant route factors, was desired. However, information provision was also denied. Participants argued the responsibility should not be left to the commuters and planning for exposed road users would be crucial. Information provision may not be worthwhile if planning authorities do not provide healthy alternatives. People-centered approaches for tackling air pollution and noise exposure en route should be investigated further.",EUR TRANSP RES REV,DEC,2022,10.1186/s12544-022-00571-0,Transportation; Transportation Science & Technology,6A0AC,WOS:000880324900001

A collaborative typology of boreal Indigenous landscapes,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH,"Climate change and natural resource extraction are transforming boreal forest landscapes, with effects on Indigenous people's relationship with the land. Collaborative management could enhance the consideration of Indigenous perspectives and limit negative outcomes of environmental change, but it remains the exception rather than the norm. We addressed barriers to involvement of Indigenous people in land management by developing a method to enhance communication and trust, while favouring bottom-up decision-making. We partnered with the Abitibiwinni and Ouje-Bougoumou First Nations (boreal Quebec, Canada) (i) to develop indicators of Indigenous landscape state, (Li) to create a typology of Indigenous hunting grounds, and (iii) to suggest guidelines for sustainable land management in Indigenous contexts. Through participatory mapping and semidirected interviews with 23 local experts, we identified factors influencing Indigenous landscape value. Using open-access data, we developed indicators to measure landscape state according to those values. We identified four types of hunting grounds with k-means clustering, based upon biophysical factors and disturbance history. Our results suggest that land management should aim to reduce differences between hunting ground states and consider the risk of rapid shifts from one state to another.",CAN J FOREST RES,SEP,2021,10.1139/cjfr-2020-0369,Forestry,UL9VK,WOS:000692990000008

An approach to consider the impact of co-designed science: Case study of Bayesian networks to set NRM targets,21ST INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION (MODSIM2015),"It is now often stated that the scientific community can gain greater impact from their work if they engage intended stakeholders in co-design, implementation and evaluation of projects. However, the evidence to substantiate these claims are rarely more than anecdotal and reflective comments from scientists. Previous evaluation methods for participatory work run the risk of being over simplistic, and therefore omit important impacts, or become too complex and not user-friendly. In this paper, we provide an intermediate option, combining the research of others (detailed in Table 1), to produce 5 key dimensions to consider when evaluating the impact of participatory projects. These dimensions are 1) an increase in knowledge and awareness, 2) a change in behavior or practice, 3) active dissemination of new knowledge, 4) change in policy or planning, or some level of government endorsement, and 5) physical system improvements or onground change. In addition, social learning, empowerment and new social norms are important, but due to complexity, they are not yet included in this method. Each dimension can be estimated for its breadth and depth of the impact by more detailed criteria (e.g. how many people have increased their knowledge? And how much more do they know (i.e. could they explain it to someone else?)). The breadth is more of a quantitative assessment, which is generally easier to measure, while the depth, particularly if self-assessed, is more likely to be qualitative and subject to bias. We provide a grid to plot the breadth and depth impacts, and the means to combine this impact into a single visual representation on a radar plot (Figure 1). Here multiple lines represent different people's views of the same project, but they could also show the impact of different projects, or both. We applied the approach to a case study where the Condamine catchment Natural Resource Management (NRM) Plan was updated to better account for the interactions of management and outcomes across the people, water, land and wildlife themes, allowing for external influences such as climate change. A series of Bayesian networks (Bns) were co-developed with key staff from the Condamine Alliance (CA) and the plan's advisory team through a series of workshops emails and phone calls. The final Bns were used to set quantitative targets in the catchment plan for monitoring and evaluation. The Bns also underpin website interactive tools, used for communication and engagement with the wider community. The impact assessment approach provided a useful structure to consider the impact of stakeholder engagement in science, but highlighted the difficulties in trying to measure impact retrospectively and without a large investment of resources. Ideally useful bounds to evaluate the impact of participatory science are discussed and decided upon prior to the commencement of a project, and if not, then the evaluation of its impact would require resourcing of its own.",NA,NA,2015,NA,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied",BI2XC,WOS:000410535400281
Can Information Technology Help Rail Play a Greater Role in Preventing Climate Change?,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD,"Increasing rail's passenger and freight transportation market share would reduce energy use and thereby reduce pollution and climate change. Unfortunately, many railroads have capacity constraints and are institutionally skeptical of introducing new products, operating strategies, and technologies that could help them better meet the needs of today's passenger and freight customers and ultimately help railways increase their market share. One solution to these problems is the clever implementation of new information technology (IT) strategies. IT can help in several ways. First, IT can help maximize the use of existing capacity. Second, IT can be used to help improve service quality by providing improved reliability and information to passengers. Finally, IT can help identify and prioritize the infrastructure investments and institutional changes needed to improve rail service. IT-based applications can help communicate the need for change to public and private decision makers. However, ultimate success will not come by simply adding IT to existing systems; rather, it will come by using IT to reinvent the railroad to provide new products and services oriented toward today's customers. The paper outlines how IT can be used to improve railway capacity and quality.",TRANSPORT RES REC,NA,2009,10.3141/2139-16,"Engineering, Civil; Transportation; Transportation Science & Technology",545XC,WOS:000273769300017
Cryogenic land surface processes shape vegetation biomass patterns in northern European tundra,COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT,"Tundra ecosystems have experienced changes in vegetation composition, distribution, and productivity over the past century due to climate warming. However, the increase in above-ground biomass may be constrained by cryogenic land surface processes that cause topsoil disturbance and variable microsite conditions. These effects have remained unaccounted for in tundra biomass models, although they can impact multiple opposing feedbacks between the biosphere and atmosphere, ecosystem functioning and biodiversity. Here, by using field-quantified data from northern Europe, remote sensing, and machine learning, we show that cryogenic land surface processes substantially constrain above-ground biomass in tundra. The three surveyed processes (cryoturbation, solifluction, and nivation) collectively reduced biomass by an average of 123.0 g m(-2) (-30.0%). This effect was significant over landscape positions and was especially pronounced in snowbed environments, where the mean reduction in biomass was 57.3%. Our results imply that cryogenic land surface processes are pivotal in shaping future patterns of tundra biomass, as long as cryogenic ground activity is retained by climate warming. Vegetation in tundra ecosystems is constrained by cryogenic land surface processes, despite the fact that models of future biomass changes rarely take these into account, according to field and remote sensing data from northern Europe.",COMMUN EARTH ENVIRON,OCT 19,2021,10.1038/s43247-021-00292-7,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",WJ2HR,WOS:000708870000001
Increases in fire risk due to warmer summer temperatures and wildland urban interface changes do not necessarily lead to more fires,APPLIED GEOGRAPHY,"Forest fire frequency in Mediterranean countries is expected to increase with land cover and climate changes as temperatures rise and rainfall patterns are altered. Although the cause of many Mediterranean fires remains poorly defined, most fires are of anthropogenic origin and are located in the wildland urban interface (WUI), so fire ignition risk depends on both weather and land cover characteristics. The objectives of this study were to quantify the overall trends in forest fire risk in the WUI of the Alpes-Maritimes department in SE France over a period of almost 50 years (about 1960-2009) and relate these to changes in land cover and temperature changes. Land cover for two contrasting reference catchments (236 km(2) and 289 km(2), respectively) was mapped from available aerial photographs. Changes in fire risk over time were estimated using statistical relationships defined for each type of WUI, where isolated and scattered housing present a greater risk than dense and very dense housing. Summer monthly temperatures and spring and summer precipitation were quantified over the same temporal period as land cover. Finally, trends in fire frequency and burned area were analyzed over a shorter 37 year period (1973-2009) due to the lack of available fire data before 1973. Fire risk associated with WUI expansion increased by about 18%-80% over the 1960-2009 period (depending on the catchment). Similarly, mean summer minimum and maximum monthly temperatures increased by 1.8 degrees C and 1.4 degrees C, respectively, over the same period. Summer rainfall appears to decrease over time since about the 1970's but remains highly variable. Land cover and weather changes both suggest an overall increase in fire risk. However, the number of fires and burned area have decreased significantly since about 1990. This paradoxical result is due to a change in fire-fighting strategy which reinforced the systematic extinction of fires in their early stages. Technical support in the form of improved radio communication and helicopters contributed greatly to reducing fire frequency and burned area. Surveillance and legal reforms included the introduction of field patrols and restricted access to forests during high risk periods. Although this has proven highly successful in the short term, the risk of fuel load accumulation over time remains a risk which might contribute to the development of mega-fires in extreme climatic conditions in the future.

Safeguarding food security through large-scale adoption of agricultural production technologies: The case of greenhouse farming in Ghana,CLEANER ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY,"Africa risk achieving its food security target due to the predominance of open field rain-fed production systems, worsening climate change impacts, environmentally unsustainable agronomic practices and low productivity. Large scale adoption of new and clean production technologies can overcome these challenges and increase productivity in an environmentally sustainable manner. However, large scale technological adoption faces several research, policy and financial challenges which must be identified and resolved. Despite the introduction of greenhouse technology in Ghana more than a decade ago to ensure sustained domestic supply of vegetables throughout the year, importation of vegetables has continued to increase. This study sought to address the problem of low adoption of greenhouse technology by investigating the barriers to their large scale adoption as well as associated opportunities. For the first time, stakeholders in research and academia, policy and business communities were consulted through questionnaire administration and personal communication to address this problem. Secondary data such as policy documents, strategies and plans of relevant ministries and allied institutions were reviewed. Quantitative and qualitative data analysis approaches were employed to process and analyse the data. The results revealed that, barriers to large scale adoption of the technology pertained to unsuitability of existing greenhouse designs to Ghana's climatic and other biophysical conditions, lack of locally adapted seeds, low technical expertise to manage the production process, high utility charges, lack of access to finance/credit and limited collaboration between initiatives of relevant ministries and also between ministries, research and business communities. These results call for a stronger collaboration between the three communities in (i) establishing a local fabrication industry, (ii) developing locally adapted seeds and solutions for pest and disease management, (iii) developing skills and enhancing capacity and extension services, (iv) value addition and marketing and (v) improving access to finance/credit for young entrepreneurs.",CLEAN ENG TECHNOL,FEB,2022,10.1016/j.clet.2021.100384,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",F2UF7,WOS:000980943000031

Uncovering climate (in)justice with an adaptive capacity assessment: A multiple case study in rural coastal North Carolina,LAND USE POLICY,"Climate change resilience is an area of praxis where efforts to enhance community adaptive capacity are informed by theory. However, there is growing evidence that ethnocentrism and privilege are shaping coastal management policies while many communities with climate justice issues struggle to build resilience. Particularly, rural coastal communities, contrasting urban areas, have limited access to centralized planning efforts, unique local contexts for outreach, compounding social vulnerabilities (job loss, out-migration, limited social services), and receive less attention from resilience researchers. Following calls to integrate climate justice into resilience praxis, we assess perceptions of adaptive capacity within predominately African American communities in a rural low-lying coastal region in eastern North Carolina. We add a climate justice lens to evaluate the previously-validated Rural Coastal Community Resilience (RCCR) framework. The RCCR is intended to improve planning efforts by providing climate change information, initiating conversations, and contributing to resilience theory. In contrast to its previous applications, engagement led to declines in perceived adaptive capacity. This result highlights that the information sharing goals of the engagement efforts were poorly aligned with community concerns and threat perceptions. Additionally, perceived climate injustices emerged revealing instances of adaptation oppression. This study recommends strategies to rethink traditional extension efforts to improve inclusiveness by deeply interrogating the inherent whiteness of standard modes of communicating climate science.",LAND USE POLICY,MAY,2020,10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.104547,Environmental Studies,LE4WJ,WOS:000526720000062

Factors associated with older adults' perception of health risks of hot and cold weather event exposure: A scoping review,FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH,"IntroductionHot and cold weather events are increasingly becoming a global burden resulting in premature and preventable morbidity and mortality, particularly in vulnerable groups such as older people and people with chronic health conditions. However, risk perception regarding weather is generally poor among vulnerable groups which often acts as a barrier to the uptake of critical health-protective behaviours. A more cohesive understanding of determinants of risk perception is needed to inform public health risk communication and behaviour change interventions that promote protective health behaviours. This scoping literature review aimed to understand factors influencing perception of personal health risks in vulnerable groups as a result of exposure to hot and cold weather events. MethodsA five-stage scoping review framework was followed. Searches were run across Medline, PsychInfo, Web of Science and EMBASE. Papers were included if they provided rationale for risk perceptions in vulnerable groups in indoor/domestic environments and focussed on samples from OECD countries. ResultsIn total, 13 out of 15,554 papers met the full inclusion criteria. The majority of papers focused on hot weather events: one study exclusively examined cold weather events and one study addressed both cold and hot weather events. Included papers focused on older adults aged 65+ years. The papers identified eight factors that were associated with older adults' personal health risk perception of hot and cold weather events: (1) Knowledge of the relationship between hot/cold weather and health risks, (2) presence of comorbidities, (3) age and self-identity, (4) perceived weather severity, (5) Beliefs associated with regional climate, (6) past experience with weather, (7) misconceptions of effectiveness of protective behaviours, and (8) external locus of control. ConclusionsFuture research should explore risk communication methods by implementing the identified risk perception determinants from this review into health protection interventions targeting older adults. Further understanding is needed regarding risk perceptions in non-elderly vulnerable groups, for examples individuals with chronic diseases or disabilities.",FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH,NOV 10,2022,10.3389/fpubh.2022.939859,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",6O1RV,WOS:000890023600001
Hallett-Mossop Rime Splintering Dims Cumulus Clouds Over the Southern Ocean: New Insight From Nudged Global Storm-Resolving Simulations,AGU ADVANCES,"In clouds containing both liquid and ice with temperatures between -3 degrees C and -8 degrees C, liquid droplets collide with large ice crystals, freeze, and shatter, producing a plethora of small ice splinters. This process, known as Hallett-Mossop rime splintering, and other forms of secondary ice production, can cause clouds to reflect less sunlight and to have shorter lifetimes. We show its impact on Southern Ocean shallow cumuli using a novel suite of five global storm-resolving simulations, which partition the Earth's atmosphere into 2-4 km wide columns. We evaluate simulated clouds and radiation over the Southern Ocean with aircraft observations from the Southern Ocean Clouds, Radiation, Aerosol Transport Experimental Study (SOCRATES), and satellite observations from Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and Himawari. Simulations with large concentrations of ice crystals in boundary layer clouds, which agree better with SOCRATES observations, have reduced mixed-phase cumulus cloud cover and weaker shortwave cloud radiative effects (CREs) that are less biased compared with CERES. Using a pair of simulations differing only in their treatment of Hallett-Mossop rime splintering, we show that including this process increases ice crystal concentrations in cumulus clouds and weakens shortwave CREs over the Southern Ocean by 10 W m(-2). We also demonstrate the key role that global storm-resolving models can play in detangling the effects of clouds on Earth's climate across scales, making it possible to trace the impact of changes in individual cumulus cloud anvils (10 km(2)) on the radiative budget of the massive Southern Ocean basin (10(7) km(2)).",AGU ADV,APR,2022,10.1029/2021AV000454,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",0H2UM,WOS:000778592300001

Fructan Contents in Australian Wheat Varieties Released Over the Last 150 Years,CEREAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS,"Grain fructans play an important role in the physiology of wheat plants and also impact on the health of consumers of wheat-based products. Given the potential economic importance of fructan levels, if genetic variability could be identified for this trait, it may be a potentially useful breeding target for developing climate-resilient and nutritionally enhanced wheat varieties. The aim of the current study was to screen 78 genetically diverse Australian wheat varieties released between 1860 and 2015 to determine if historic breeding targets have resulted in changes in fructan levels and to identify potential breeding parents for the development of varieties with specific fructan levels. The impact of seasonal conditions on grain fructan levels were also investigated. Analysis of the varieties in this study indicated that historic breeding targets have not impacted on grain fructan levels. Fructan content in flours varied between 1.01 to 2.27%, showing some variation among the varieties. However, a significant variation in fructan levels was observed between different harvest years (mean values for 2015 and 2016 samples were 1.38 and 1.74%, respectively). While large variations in fructan contents of different varieties were not found, there were some varieties with consistently higher or lower fructan contents which could be used to breed varieties with specific fructan levels.",CEREAL RES COMMUN,DEC,2019,10.1556/0806.47.2019.41,Agronomy,JN5XE,WOS:000496970200008
A scoping review of the green parenthood effect on environmental and climate engagement,WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE,"We review the existing literature on the role of parenthood as a motivator of environmental engagement (the green parenthood effect), focusing particularly on climate change. We find that parenthood is severely understudied as a mechanism that may influence climate change-relevant behavior. The literature on the role of parenthood in driving environmental engagement is mixed, due in part to the role of baseline individual and group characteristics that lead to different impacts of parenthood on environmental engagement as well as to the countervailing impact of intense time and budget constraints imposed by parenthood. Some studies suggest that parenthood increases pro-environmental engagements, while others find no effects or negative effects. We theorize that potential mediators and moderators need to be taken into account to get a clearer picture of how parenthood influences pro-environmental engagement. We highlight underlying proposed mechanisms that might be activated during the transition to parenthood (i.e., legacy motives, generativity, perceived responsibility), potential moderators of the green parenthood effect, and insights for public engagement.This article is categorized under:Climate, Nature, and Ethics > Climate Change and Global JusticePerceptions, Behavior, and Communication of Climate Change > Social Amplification/Attenuation of Climate RisksPerceptions, Behavior, and Communication of Climate Change > Behavior Change and ResponsesThe Social Status of Climate Change Knowledge > Climate Science and Social Movements",WIRES CLIM CHANGE,MAR,2023,10.1002/wcc.818,Environmental Studies; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,9U7DC,WOS:000919620900001
Burned forests impact water supplies,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"Wildland fire impacts on surface freshwater resources have not previously been measured, nor factored into regional water management strategies. But, large wildland fires are increasing and raise concerns about fire impacts on potable water. Here we synthesize long-term records of wildland fire, climate, and river flow for 168 locations across the United States. We show that annual river flow changed in 32 locations, where more than 19% of the basin area was burned. Wildland fires enhanced annual river flow in the western regions with a warm temperate or humid continental climate. Wildland fires increased annual river flow most in the semi-arid Lower Colorado region, in spite of frequent droughts in this region. In contrast, prescribed burns in the subtropical Southeast did not significantly alter river flow. These extremely variable outcomes offer new insights into the potential role of wildfire and prescribed fire in regional water resource management, under a changing climate.",NAT COMMUN,APR 10,2018,10.1038/s41467-018-03735-6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,GC1DZ,WOS:000429520900001
Public perception of the relationship between climate change and unconventional gas development (fracking') in the US,CLIMATE POLICY,"Fracking', or unconventional gas development via hydraulic fracturing (hereafter UGD'), has been closely tied to global climate change in academic discourse. Researchers have debated the life cycle emissions of shale gas versus coal, rates of methane leakage from wellhead production and transmission infrastructure, the extent to which coal would be displaced by gas as a source of energy, the appropriate time-scale for accounting for the global warming potentials of methane and carbon dioxide, surface versus airborne methane measurements, and the effect of lowered energy prices on gas consumption. Little research, however, has examined the degree to which these potential connections between UGD and climate change are relevant to the general public. This article presents two surveys, one of a representative national (US) sample and one of a representative sample of residents in the Marcellus Shale region of Pennsylvania and New York. It examines whether respondents associated UGD with climate change, and the relationship between this association and their support for, or opposition to, UGD. The results reveal that beliefs about many other potential impacts of UGD explain more variation in support and opposition than do beliefs about UGD's association with climate change. Furthermore, most other impacts of UGD are viewed as having more effect on quality of life if they were to occur, at least amongst the Marcellus Shale survey sample. The article concludes with implications of the findings for policy and communication on UGD.Key policy insights Public opinion about unconventional gas development (UGD or fracking') is affected less by beliefs about its impact on global climate change, than about several other more local factors.Communication tailored to increase awareness of UGD's impacts would likely be most effective when focusing on the local level, as opposed to national or global impacts.Messaging about UGD's relationship with carbon emissions would have more effect in national-level discourse, as opposed to messaging targeted at communities experiencing or potentially experiencing development.To maintain credibility and societal trust, communication on the global climate impacts of UGD needs to be informative but non-persuasive.",CLIM POLICY,NA,2018,10.1080/14693062.2017.1389686,Environmental Studies; Public Administration,GA2MK,WOS:000428156600002
Future climate change will increase risk to mangrove health in Northern Australia,COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT,"Mangroves of the wet-dry tropical Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia, survive in a harsh environment. One of the worst recorded mangrove dieback events occurred during the El Nino of 2015 following an extreme, two-year sea level drop, illustrating that enhanced climate variability can exacerbate major stressors for these ecosystems. As well as sea level variability, maximum daily temperatures in the Gulf of Carpentaria are also linked to climate variability and change, and may play an important role in overall mangrove health. Here we address how these two factors: sea level variability and maximum daily temperatures, are projected to change under several future emissions scenarios. Climate projections from the sixth generation of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project indicate an increased occurrence of anomalously low and high sea level events in the coming century. This, alongside enhanced temperature stress, is likely to significantly increase risk to mangrove health in this region. The rate of increase of low and high sea level events, and high temperature events, is scenario-dependent, and is largest for a high-emissions scenario. The health of mangroves from the Gulf of Carpentaria will be affected by increasingly frequent abnormal sea levels and increased heat stress in the future, according to model simulations driven by two plausible future climate scenarios",COMMUN EARTH ENVIRON,MAY 30,2023,10.1038/s43247-023-00852-z,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",H8QY2,WOS:000998554100001
"Improving dialogue among researchers, local and indigenous peoples and decision-makers to address issues of climate change in the North",AMBIO,"The Circumpolar North has been changing rapidly within the last decades, and the socioeconomic systems of the Eurasian Arctic and Siberia in particular have displayed the most dramatic changes. Here, anthropogenic drivers of environmental change such as migration and industrialization are added to climate-induced changes in the natural environment such as permafrost thawing and increased frequency of extreme events. Understanding and adapting to both types of changes are important to local and indigenous peoples in the Arctic and for the wider global community due to transboundary connectivity. As local and indigenous peoples, decision-makers and scientists perceive changes and impacts differently and often fail to communicate efficiently to respond to changes adequately, we convened a meeting of the three groups in Salekhard in 2017. The outcomes of the meeting include perceptions of how the three groups each perceive the main issues affecting health and well-being and recommendations for working together better.",AMBIO,JUN,2020,10.1007/s13280-019-01277-9,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",KZ5JP,WOS:000495955900002

Factors of subjective heat stress of urban citizens in contexts of everyday life,NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"Heat waves and the consequent heat stress of urban populations have a growing relevance in urban risk management and strategies of urban adaptation to climate change. In this context, social science studies on subjective experiencing of heat as stress by urban citizens are a new emerging field. To contribute to the understanding of self-reported subjective heat stress and its major determinants in a daily life perspective, we conducted a questionnaire survey with 323 respondents in Karlsruhe, Germany, after heat waves in July and August 2013. Statistical data analysis showed that subjective heat stress is an issue permeating everyday activities. Subjective heat stress at home was lower than at work and in general. Subjective heat stress in general, at home, and at work was determined by the health impairments experienced during the heat and the feeling of being helplessly exposed to the heat. For subjective heat stress at home, characteristics of the residential building and the built environment additionally played a role. Although the rate of implemented coping measures was rather high, coping measures showed no uniform effect for the subjective heat stress. We conclude that in terms of urban adaptation strategies, further research is needed to understand how various processes of daily social (work) life enable or limit individual coping and that communication strategies are important for building capacities to better cope with future heat waves.",NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS,NA,2016,10.5194/nhess-16-977-2016,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Water Resources",DP0UZ,WOS:000378206700006
The predictive power of exponential numeracy,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY,"Many fundamental relationships, from the spread of disease to climate change, as well as common scales, such as the Richter, pH, and Decibel scales, are characterized by exponential relationships. Across six pre-registered studies (N = 3522) and three supplemental studies (N = 1079), we introduce and test a measure of exponential numeracy. We demonstrate that individuals with greater exponential numeracy are better able to recognize, understand, and predict exponential trends. In doing so, we make several important contributions. First, we show that exponential numeracy helps people predict consequential phenomena, such as the spread of COVID-19 and sales of a popular product after launch. Second, compared to people low in exponential numeracy, people high in exponential numeracy are less influenced by anchoring when forecasting exponential phenomena. Third, we link exponential numeracy with the ability to understand common data presentations. We demonstrate that different presentations of exponential data predictably influence forecast accuracy, but that exponential numeracy mitigates these effects. Our findings have important implications for communicating exponential trends and advance our understanding of how individuals make decisions involving exponential relationships.",J EXP SOC PSYCHOL,JUL,2022,10.1016/j.jesp.2022.104347,"Psychology, Social",1T1DX,WOS:000804479500003
Facilitating Change for Climate-Smart Agriculture through Science-Policy Engagement,SUSTAINABILITY,"Climate change impacts on agriculture have become evident, and threaten the achievement of global food security. On the other hand, the agricultural sector itself is a cause of climate change, and if actions are not taken, the sector might impede the achievement of global climate goals. Science-policy engagement efforts are crucial to ensure that scientific findings from agricultural research for development inform actions of governments, private sector, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and international development partners, accelerating progress toward global goals. However, knowledge gaps on what works limit progress. In this paper, we analyzed 34 case studies of science-policy engagement efforts, drawn from six years of agricultural research for development efforts around climate-smart agriculture by the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS). Based on lessons derived from these case studies, we critically assessed and refined the program theory of the CCAFS program, leading to a revised and improved program theory for science-policy engagement for agriculture research for development under climate change. This program theory offers a pragmatic pathway to enhance credibility, salience and legitimacy of research, which relies on engagement (participatory and demand-driven research processes), evidence (building scientific credibility while adopting an opportunistic and flexible approach) and outreach (effective communication and capacity building).",SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,AUG,2018,10.3390/su10082616,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,GW3CI,WOS:000446767700032
"The role of botanical gardens in scientific research, conservation, and citizen science",PLANT DIVERSITY,"Plant diversity is currently being lost at an unprecedented rate, resulting in an associated decrease in ecosystem services. About a third of the world's vascular plant species face the threat of extinction due to a variety of devastating activities, including, over-harvesting and over exploitation, destructive agricultural and forestry practices, urbanization, environmental pollution, land-use changes, exotic invasive species, global climate change, and more. We therefore need to increase our efforts to develop integrative conservation approaches for plant species conservation. Botanical gardens devote their resources to the study and conservation of plants, as well as making the world's plant species diversity known to the public. These gardens also play a central role in meeting human needs and providing well-being. In this minireview, a framework for the integrated missions of botanical gardens, including scientific research, in/ex situ conservation, plant resource utilization, and citizen science are cataloged. By reviewing the history of the development of Kunming Botanical Garden, we illustrate successful species conservation approaches (among others, projects involving Camellia, Rhododendron, Magnolia, Begonia, Allium, Ne-penthes, medicinal plants, ornamental plants, and Plant Species with Extreme Small Populations), as well as citizen science, and scientific research at Kunming Botanical Garden over the past 80 years. We emphasize that Kunming Botanical Garden focuses largely on the ex situ conservation of plants from Southwest China, especially those endangered, endemic, and economically important plant species native to the Yunnan Plateau and the southern Hengduan Mountains. We also discuss the future challenges and responsibilities of botanical gardens in a changing world, including: the negative effects of outbreeding and/or inbreeding depression; promoting awareness, study, and conservation of plant species diversity; accelerating global access to information about plant diversity; increasing capacity building and training activities. We hope this minireview can promote understanding of the role of botanical gardens. Copyright (C) 2018 Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Identification of stable QTLs for vegetative and reproductive traits in the microvine (Vitis vinifera L.) using the 18 K Infinium chip,BMC PLANT BIOLOGY,"Background: The increasing temperature associated with climate change impacts grapevine phenology and development with critical effects on grape yield and composition. Plant breeding has the potential to deliver new cultivars with stable yield and quality under warmer climate conditions, but this requires the identification of stable genetic determinants. This study tested the potentialities of the microvine to boost genetics in grapevine. A mapping population of 129 microvines derived from Picovine x Ugni Blanc flb, was genotyped with the Illumina (R) 18 K SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) chip. Forty-three vegetative and reproductive traits were phenotyped outdoors over four cropping cycles, and a subset of 22 traits over two cropping cycles in growth rooms with two contrasted temperatures, in order to map stable QTLs (Quantitative Trait Loci). Results: Ten stable QTLs for berry development and quality or leaf area were identified on the parental maps. A new major QTL explaining up to 44 % of total variance of berry weight was identified on chromosome 7 in Ugni Blanc flb, and co-localized with QTLs for seed number (up to 76 % total variance), major berry acids at green lag phase (up to 35 %), and other yield components (up to 25 %). In addition, a minor QTL for leaf area was found on chromosome 4 of the same parent. In contrast, only minor QTLs for berry acidity and leaf area could be found as moderately stable in Picovine. None of the transporters recently identified as mutated in low acidity apples or Cucurbits were included in the several hundreds of candidate genes underlying the above berry QTLs, which could be reduced to a few dozen candidate genes when a priori pertinent biological functions and organ specific expression were considered. Conclusions: This study combining the use of microvine and a high throughput genotyping technology was innovative for grapevine genetics. It allowed the identification of 10 stable QTLs, including the first berry acidity QTLs reported so far in a Vitis vinifera intra-specific cross. Robustness of a set of QTLs was assessed with respect to temperature variation.",BMC PLANT BIOL,AUG 19,2015,10.1186/s12870-015-0588-0,Plant Sciences,CO9TJ,WOS:000359518600002
AI System for Monitoring States and Power Consumption of Household Appliances,IEEE ICCE 2020: 2020 IEEE EIGHTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS (ICCE),"Global warming is a major problem in the 21st century. One of the most effective ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to save energy, in which electricity is the energy source with high demand and daily increasing. Residential electricity accounts for a large proportion of the total amount of electricity produced, thus if each individual can use electricity at home more effectively, it also means that we are slowing down the process of climate change. The feedback on the energy consumption of household appliances gives users a clearer view of daily electricity consumption, and this will help them to have more efficient ways to consume electricity. In this paper, the authors have built a system to monitor the on/off status and energy consumption of each electrical appliances in the house. The system only uses an electronic meter and software run machine learning algorithms on computers.

Climate variation explains a third of global crop yield variability,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"Many studies have examined the role of mean climate change in agriculture, but an understanding of the influence of inter-annual climate variations on crop yields in different regions remains elusive. We use detailed crop statistics time series for similar to 13,500 political units to examine how recent climate variability led to variations in maize, rice, wheat and soybean crop yields worldwide. While some areas show no significant influence of climate variability, in substantial areas of the global breadbaskets, >60% of the yield variability can be explained by climate variability. Globally, climate variability accounts for roughly a third (similar to 32-39%) of the observed yield variability. Our study uniquely illustrates spatial patterns in the relationship between climate variability and crop yield variability, highlighting where variations in temperature, precipitation or their interaction explain yield variability. We discuss key drivers for the observed variations to target further research and policy interventions geared towards buffering future crop production from climate variability.",NAT COMMUN,JAN,2015,10.1038/ncomms6989,Multidisciplinary Sciences,CA3MY,WOS:000348812100007
Integrative oncology in cancer care - implementation factors: mixed-methods systematic review,BMJ SUPPORTIVE & PALLIATIVE CARE,"BackgroundIntegrative oncology (IO) appears to be beneficial to patients with cancer, but its implementation remains a challenge. Guided by the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) model, this systematic review identified the barriers to and facilitators of IO implementation in conventional cancer care settings. MethodsWe searched eight electronic databases from their inception until February 2022 for qualitative, quantitative or mixed-methods empirical studies reporting the implementation outcomes for IO services. Critical appraisal approach was tailored according to study types. The identified implementation barriers and facilitators were mapped onto TDF domains and the COM-B model, and subsequently onto the behavioural change wheel (BCW) for formulating behavioural change interventions. ResultsWe included 28 studies (11 qualitative, 6 quantitative, 9 mixed-methods and 2 Delphi studies) of satisfied methodological quality. The main implementation barriers were the lack of IO knowledge, the absence of funding and healthcare professionals' low level of IO receptiveness. The key implementation facilitators were the dissemination of evidence on IO clinical benefits, the equipping of professionals with IO service delivery skills and the provision of a supportive organisational climate. ConclusionMultifaceted implementation strategies are needed to address the determinants influencing IO service delivery. Based on our BCW-based analysis of the included studies, the key behavioural change techniques are: (1) educating healthcare professionals about the value and application of traditional and complementary medicine; (2) ensuring access to actionable clinical evidence on IO effectiveness and safety and (3) designing guidelines on communicating traditional and complementary medicine interventions with patients and caregivers for biomedically trained doctors and nurses.",BMJ SUPPORT PALLIAT,2023 MAY 12,2023,10.1136/spcare-2022-004150,Health Care Sciences & Services,G7CI5,WOS:000990691100001
"Accessing habitat suitability and connectivity for the westernmost population of Asian black bear (Ursus thibetanus gedrosianus, Blanford, 1877) based on climate changes scenarios in Iran",PLOS ONE,"Climate change, as an emerging phenomenon, has led to changes in the distribution, movement, and even risk of extinction of various wildlife species and this has raised concerns among conservation biologists. Different species have two options in the face of climate change, either to adopt or follow their climatic niche to new places through the connectivity of habitats. The modeling of interpatch landscape communications can serve as an effective decision support tool for wildlife managers. This study was conducted to assess the effects of climate change on the distribution and habitat connectivity of the endangered subspecies of Asian black bear (Ursus thibetanus gedrosianus) in the southern and southeastern Iran. The presence points of the species were collected in Provinces of Kerman, Hormozgan, and Sistan-Baluchestan. Habitat modeling was done by the Generalized Linear Model, and 3 machine learning models including Maximum Entropy, Back Propagation based artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine. In order to achieve the ensemble model, the results of the mentioned models were merged based on the method of accuracy rate as weight derived from their validation. To construct pseudo-absence points for the use in the mentioned models, the Ensemble model of presence-only models was used. The modeling was performed using 15 habitat variables related to climatic, vegetation, topographic, and anthropogenic parameters. The three general circulation models of BCC-CSM1, CCSM4, and MRI-CGCM3 were selected under the two scenarios of RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 by 2070. To investigate the effect of climate change on the habitat connections, the protected areas of 3 provinces were considered as focal nodes and the connections between them were established based on electrical circuit theory and Pairwise method. The true skill statistic was employed to convert the continuous suitability layers to binary suitable/unsuitable range maps to assess the effectiveness of the protected areas in the coverage of suitable habitats for the species. Due to the high power of the stochastic forest model in determining the importance of variables, this method was used. The results showed that presence/absence models were successful in the implementation and well distinguished the points of presence and pseudo-absence from each other. Based on the random forests model, the variables of Precipitation of Driest Quarter, Precipitation of Coldest Quarter, and Temperature Annual Range have the greatest impact on the habitat suitability. Comparing the modeling findings to the realities of the species distribution range indicated that the suitable habitats are located in areas with high humidity and rainfall, which are mostly in the northern areas of Bandar Abbas, south of Kerman, and west and south of Sistan-Baluchestan. The area of suitable habitats, in the MRI-CGCM3 (189731 Km(2)) and CCSM4 (179007 Km(2)) models under the RCP2.6 scenario, is larger than the current distribution (174001 Km(2)). However, in terms of the performance of protected areas, the optimal coverage of the species by the boundary of the protected areas, under each of the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios, is less than the present time. According to the electric circuit theory, connecting the populations in the protected areas of Sistan-Baluchestan province to those in the northern Hormozgan and the southern Kerman would be based on the crossing through the heights of Sistan-Baluchestan and Hormozgan provinces and the plains between these heights would be the movement pinch points under the current and future scenarios. Populations in the protected areas of Kerman have higher quality patch connections than that of the other two provinces. The areas such as Sang-e_Mes, Kouh_Shir, Zaryab, and Bahr_Aseman in Kerman Province and Kouhbaz and Geno in Hormozgan Province can provide suitable habitats for the species in the distribution models. The findings revealed that the conservation of the heights along with the caves inside them could be a protective priority to counteract the effects of climate change on the species.",PLOS ONE,NOV 18,2020,10.1371/journal.pone.0242432,Multidisciplinary Sciences,OZ9VG,WOS:000595265900048

From the perspective of human visual saliency, our paper proposes a novel infrared dim small target detection algorithm based on frequency domain saliency. First, we get saliency map in the frequency domain. The algorithm combines the amplitude spectrum filtered by Gaussian low-pass filter with an appropriate scale and the phase spectrum, and then obtain saliency map by inverse Fourier transform. Secondly, we get saliency regions by segmenting the saliency map, and then use the gray centroid method to locate saliency regions. Finally, the small target is identified by local contrast algorithm. Experimental results show that our algorithm proposed higher detection accuracy for infrared images with different background, and can also suppress global repetitive clutter.

It facilitates decision making supported by the mobile application ITWSM-app. Information flows easily through the different decision levels involved in the management process, keeping updated the georeferenced database after system changes. ITWSM has been implemented in a real public water supply company and applied to manage breakdown repairs in water transmission systems. The use of the proposed methodology reduces the average cost of failure repair by 13.6%, mainly due to the optimal planning of the resources involved.",WATER-SUI,DEC,2021,10.3390/w13243652,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,XY9XX,WOS:000737318900001
"Evaluation of an E-Learning Training Program to Support Implementation of a Group-Based, Theory-Driven, Self-Management Intervention For Osteoarthritis and Low-Back Pain: Pre-Post Study",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,"Background:By adaptation of the face-to-face physiotherapist-training program previously used in the Self-management of Osteoarthritis and Low back pain through Activity and Skills (SOLAS) feasibility trial, an asynchronous, interactive, Web-based, e-learning training program (E-SOLAS) underpinned by behavior and learning theories was developed. Objective: This study investigated the effect of the E-SOLAS training program on relevant outcomes of effective training and implementation. Methods: Thirteen physiotherapists from across Ireland were trained via E-SOLAS by using mixed methods, and seven physiotherapists progressed to implementation of the 6-week group-based SOLAS intervention. The effectiveness of E-SOLAS was evaluated using the Kirkpatrick model at the levels of reaction (physiotherapist engagement and satisfaction with E-SOLAS training methods and content), learning (pre- to posttraining changes in physiotherapists' confidence and knowledge in delivering SOLAS content and self-determination theory-based communication strategies, administered via a SurveyMonkey questionnaire), and behavior (fidelity to delivery of SOLAS content using physiotherapist-completed weekly checklists). During implementation, five physiotherapists audio recorded delivery of one class, and the communication between physiotherapists and clients was assessed using the Health Care Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ), the Controlling Coach Behaviour Scale (CCBS), and an intervention-specific measure (ISM; 7-point Likert scale). A range of implementation outcomes were evaluated during training and delivery (ie, acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, and sustainability of E-SOLAS) using a posttraining feedback questionnaire and individual semistructured telephone interviews. Results: With regard to their reaction, physiotherapists (n=13) were very satisfied with E-SOLAS posttraining (median 5.0; interquartile range 1.0; min-max 4.0-5.0) and completed training within 3-4 weeks. With regard to learning, there were significant increases in physiotherapists' confidence and knowledge in delivery of all SOLAS intervention components (P<.05). Physiotherapists' confidence in 7 of 10 self-determination theory-based communication strategies increased (P<.05), whereas physiotherapists' knowledge of self-determination theory-based strategies remained high posttraining (P>.05). In terms of behavior, physiotherapists delivered SOLAS in a needs supportive manner (HCCQ: median 5.2, interquartile range 1.3, min-max 3.7-5.8; CCBS: median 6.6, interquartile range 1.0, min-max 5.6-7.0; ISM: median 4.5, interquartile range 1.2, min-max 2.8-4.8). Fidelity scores were high for SOLAS content delivery (total %mean fidelity score 93.5%; SD 4.9%). The posttraining questionnaire and postdelivery qualitative interviews showed that physiotherapists found E-SOLAS acceptable, appropriate, feasible, and sustainable within primary care services to support the implementation of the SOLAS intervention. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence of the effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of an e-learning program to train physiotherapists to deliver a group-based self-management complex intervention in primary care settings, which is equivalent to face-to-face training outcomes and would support inclusion of physiotherapists in a definitive trial of SOLAS.",J MED INTERNET RES,MAR 7,2019,10.2196/11123,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,HO9JC,WOS:000461279000001
Univariate Time Series Forecasting of Indian Agriculture Emissions,"ADVANCES IN COMPUTING AND DATA SCIENCES (ICACDS 2022), PT II","The first ever increased contribution to the GHG from human activities was due to emissions from agriculture.

Coordinated Efficient Buoys Data Collection in Large Complex Coastal Environments using UAVs,OCEANS 2017 - ANCHORAGE,"Deploying a large number of sensing buoys is a powerful tool for oceanographic, marine biology and climate change research. In this work we address the problem of efficient data collection by a team of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) from low-power, small buoys with previously unknown locations in complex coastal or remote oceanic regions with aerial restrictions. To tackle this problem we propose and develop a 3-layers architecture that search for the buoys, enables communication with them and creates a UAV communication network to recover the data.

A hidden curriculum for environmental topics in medical education: Impact on environmental knowledge and awareness of the students,GMS JOURNAL FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Objective: Climate change constitutes a major challenge. The higher education sector plays an important role in regard to climate change and the adaptation to its consequences. Various approaches toward the integration of environmental subject areas to higher education teaching have already been described in other studies, but there is a lack of data supporting the effectiveness of these approaches in changing not only the environmental knowledge of students, but also their awareness. To address this, the present study tracked whether student attitudes about the environment could be changed by implicitly addressing medically relevant environmental topics as part of an online seminar. Methods: Second semester students of molecular medicine attending a mandatory 14-hour online seminar, which was required to obtain additive key qualifications and which consisted of independent study phases as well as online class meetings, were divided into two groups: the intervention group (IG, n=27, thereof 20 in the pretest and 21 in the posttest) was exposed to medically relevant environmental topics, while the comparison group (CG, n=26, thereof 22 in the pretest and 21 in the posttest) was exposed to general, non-environmental medical topics. Surveys were conducted with standardized questionnaires before and after the seminar in order to study the influence on the students' environmental knowledge, awareness and other personal attitudes. Results: While the seminar did not significantly change the environmental awareness in either group, the environmental knowledge of the IG was significantly increased by the group's exposure to environmental topics. In addition, the IG assessed its own environmental awareness regarding sustainable working methods in a laboratory as significantly higher after the seminar than the CG did, and some students of the IG had become more interested in issues relating to sustainability. Conclusion: The approach used to communicate environmental content mainly increased the environmental knowledge of students and piqued the interest of some students in climate-related and environmental topics. However, it was not possible to change deeper personal attitudes about environmental awareness, especially everyday behavior.",GMS J MED EDU,NA,2023,NA,"Education, Scientific Disciplines",H5KF7,WOS:000996342700010
"Climate Change, Bushfire Risk, and Environmental Values: Examining a Potential Risk Perception Threshold in Peri-Urban South Australia",SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES,"Striking a balance between the management of environmental risks and values is a challenge for decision-makers. If people perceive that environmental risks are increasing they may be willing to discount local values to manage those risks, so the identification of thresholds in risk perception in relation to specific behaviors could help to avoid policy failures. The complex relationships between perceptions of climate change and bushfire risks, environmental values and support for actions to mitigate local risks are presented for peri-urban regions in South Australia. The results of a household survey (N=988) suggest that a threshold of risk perception in relation to climate change and bushfire management has not been exceeded and people are broadly supportive of balanced management interventions. A minority of people still do not perceive that climate change is increasing bushfire risk, and are supportive of risk mitigation interventions even at the expense of local biodiversity. However, a larger group believe that climate change is a driver of bushfire risk, yet are still more likely to prioritize ecological values and are unwilling to discount those values for risk mitigation.

The impact of information and communication technology on carbon emissions in China: spatial effect and mechanism discussion,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,"Information and communication technology (ICT) has exerted a great impact on the socio-economic development; however, this development has come with some potential influence on climate change. The academics are divided over this issue; some argue that ICT has contributed to carbon reduction, while others consider that ICT has increased carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Undoubtedly, the existing literature abounds in the relationship between ICT and CO2 emissions, but little attention has been paid to the spillover effect of ICT and CO2 emissions, especially in developing countries. Hence, with the panel data of 285 China's prefecture-level cities from 2004 to 2018, this study innovatively discusses the spatial and mechanism effects of ICT on CO2 emissions, further exploring the heterogeneous impact of ICT on CO2 emissions from multiple perspectives. The empirical results confirm the positive relationship between ICT and CO2 emissions and identify the spatial spillover effect in the relationship. Furthermore, notably, the intermediary effect of energy consumption on the impact of ICT on CO2 emissions is identified. Finally, due to the differences in the geographical position, population size, and urban agglomeration of prefecture-level cities in China, the impact of ICT on CO2 emissions varies in different cities. The findings not only contribute to advancing the existing literature but also have a significant and targeted policy guiding significance for the cities to maximize the favorable influences of ICT and promote the low-carbon transformation of the whole society.",ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,FEB,2023,10.1007/s11356-022-23201-7,Environmental Sciences,F7SF8,WOS:000862233200008
Coproducing Sea Ice Predictions with Stakeholders Using Simulation,WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY,"Forecasts of sea ice evolution in the Arctic region for several months ahead can be of considerable socioeconomic value for a diverse range of marine sectors and for local community supply logistics. However, subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasts represent a significant technical challenge, and translating user needs into scientifically manageable procedures and robust user confidence requires collaboration among a range of stakeholders. We developed and tested a novel, transdisciplinary coproduction approach that combined socioeconomic scenarios and participatory, research-driven simulation gaming to test a new S2S sea ice forecast system with experienced mariners in the cruise tourism sector. Our custom-developed computerized simulation game known as ICEWISE integrated sea ice parameters, forecast technology, and human factors as a participatory environment for stakeholder engagement. We explored the value of applications-relevant S2S sea ice prediction and linked uncertainty information. Results suggest that the usefulness of S2S services is currently most evident in schedule-dependent sectors but is expected to increase as a result of anticipated changes in the physical environment and continued growth in Arctic operations. Reliable communication of uncertainty information in sea ice forecasts must be demonstrated and trialed before users gain confidence in emerging services and technologies. Mariners' own intuition, experience, and familiarity with forecast service provider reputation impact the extent to which sea ice information may reduce uncertainties and risks for Arctic mariners. Our insights into the performance of the combined foresight/simulation coproduction model in brokering knowledge across a range of domains demonstrates promise. We conclude with an overview of the potential contributions from S2S sea ice predictions and from experiential coproduction models to the development of decision-driven and science-informed climate services.",WEATHER CLIM SOC,APR,2022,10.1175/WCAS-D-21-0048.1,Environmental Studies; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,2I3UA,WOS:000814906100004

BASIEC: A Coastal Climate Service Framework for Community-Based Adaptation to Rising Sea-Levels,HANDBOOK OF CLIMATE SERVICES,"Climate change induced sea-level rise poses serious threats to coastal regions across the world and the communities in the low-lying coastal regions are at high risk. Building capacities of coastal communities to adapt to sea-level rise are increasingly high priorities for low-lying coastal regions. Climate services are believed to be a powerful mechanism to build capacities of communities, particularly at the local level. It focuses on the connection between climate science and public demand for information and services. In this context, this chapter emphasizes the importance of community-based climate services that build the capacities of local communities to prepare, manage and adapt to rising sea-levels. This study has put forth three research questions such as (1) what services do the coastal communities require; (2) how these services need to be delivered; (3) what are all the roles of climate services that can help in building capacities of coastal communities and involve them in the community-based adaptation decision-making process? This study has adopted the methodology following the recommendations and guidelines of the UNFCCC, the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS) and Fifth Assessment Report of IPCC, on climate information and services. As a result, this study has introduced BASIEC (Building capacities for Adaptation to Sea-level rise through Information, Education and Communication for coastal communities), a coastal climate service framework for community-based adaptation to rising sea-levels. The framework emerges from theoretical and empirical knowledge of community-based climate services and offers a holistic approach for integrating information, communication and education through the lens of climate change and sea-level rise. Thus, it provides a systematic starting point and guidance for local level coastal climate policy planners, decision-makers, researchers, local communities and others who hold a stake on coastal climate services for community-based adaptation to changing climate in general and sea-level rise in particular.",CLIM CHANG MANAG,NA,2020,10.1007/978-3-030-36875-3_2,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Public Administration,BR8WF,WOS:000674456500003
Enhanced light absorption by mixed source black and brown carbon particles in UK winter,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"Black carbon (BC) and light-absorbing organic carbon (brown carbon, BrC) play key roles in warming the atmosphere, but the magnitude of their effects remains highly uncertain. Theoretical modelling and laboratory experiments demonstrate that coatings on BC can enhance BC's light absorption, therefore many climate models simply assume enhanced BC absorption by a factor of similar to 1.5. However, recent field observations show negligible absorption enhancement, implying models may overestimate BC's warming. Here we report direct evidence of substantial field-measured BC absorption enhancement, with the magnitude strongly depending on BC coating amount. Increases in BC coating result from a combination of changing sources and photochemical aging processes. When the influence of BrC is accounted for, observationally constrained model calculations of the BC absorption enhancement can be reconciled with the observations. We conclude that the influence of coatings on BC absorption should be treated as a source and regionally specific parameter in climate models.",NAT COMMUN,SEP,2015,10.1038/ncomms9435,Multidisciplinary Sciences,CT9MQ,WOS:000363141700001
Conservation decision makers worry about relevancy and funding but not climate change,WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN,"Stakeholders fundamentally shape the success of wildlife management, yet little is known about how one of the most important stakeholder groups, wildlife agency decision makers, view emerging conservation challenges. Wildlife agency decision makers collectively shape how wildlife conservation unfolds in North America, but their perspectives are generally absent in the literature. Challenges including climate change, conservation funding models, and wildlife disease make understanding how wildlife decision makers view the future of wildlife conservation essential. We interviewed 48 directors and supervisory board members of wildlife agencies in the southeast United States from July 2019 to January 2020 to gauge their assessment of future conservation challenges and preferred response strategies. Declining agency relevancy and insufficient funding were the 2 most commonly identified challenges, while climate change was rarely mentioned as an issue because decision makers believed it was a relatively slow-moving background condition. Decision makers described improving relevance through education and outreach as their primary response to conservation challenges. Our results suggest that climate change-informed wildlife management may benefit from a 2-pronged approach. First, we suggest decision makers should be informed about the challenges posed by climate change, and second, existing efforts to promote diversity among constituents should include engaging groups who support tackling the threat climate change poses to wildlife conservation. Increasing the priority given to climate change adaptation efforts in wildlife agencies will likely require future research to discern which approaches can most improve the perceived salience of climate change to decision makers.",WILDLIFE SOC B,2023 JAN 31,2023,10.1002/wsb.1424,Biodiversity Conservation,8J4QA,WOS:000922401200001
"Leadership, governance and management in dental education - new societal challenges",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION,"Dental schools around the world face new challenges that raise issues with regard to how they are governed, led and managed. With rapid societal changes, including globalization and consumerism, the roles of universities and their funding have become intensely debated topics. When financial burdens on universities increase, so does the pressure on dental schools. This is exacerbated by the relative expense of running dental schools and also by the limited understanding of both university managers and the public of the nature and scope of dentistry as a profession. In these circumstances, it is essential for dental schools to have good systems of leadership and management in place so that they can not only survive in difficult times, but flourish in the longer term. This paper discusses the concept of governance and how it relates to leadership, management and administration in dental schools and hospitals. Various approaches to governance and management in dental schools on different continents and regions are summarized and contrasted. A number of general governance and leadership issues are addressed. For example, a basic principle supported by the Working Group is that an effective governance structure must link authority and responsibility to performance and review, i.e. accountability, and that the mechanism for achieving this should be transparent. The paper also addresses issues specific to governing, leading and managing dental schools. Being a dean of a modern dental school is a very demanding role and some issues relating to this role are raised, including: dilemmas facing deans, preparing to be dean and succession planning. The importance of establishing a shared vision and mission, and creating the right culture and climate within a dental school, are emphasized. The Working Group advocates establishing a culture of scholarship in dental schools for both teaching and research. The paper addresses the need for effective staff management, motivation and development, and highlights the salience of good communication. The Working Group suggests establishing an advisory board to the dean and school, including lay persons and other external stakeholders, as one way of separating governance and management to some extent and providing some checks and balances within a dental school. Several other suggestions and recommendations are made about governance, management and leadership issues, including the need for schools to promote an awareness of their roles by good communication and thereby influence perceptions of others about their roles and values.",EUR J DENT EDUC,FEB,2008,10.1111/j.1600-0579.2007.00495.x,"Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine; Education, Scientific Disciplines",269MO,WOS:000253653300017
Aircraft-Specific Thermoelectric Generator Module,JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS,"Autonomous sensor nodes for wireless sensor networks are currently under discussion for aircraft structural health monitoring. Self-sufficient operation of a sensor node requires a positive power budget for sensing, processing, and communication tasks. Energy harvesting for autonomous powering by thermoelectric devices depends strongly on maintaining the temperature difference within the aircraft operation envelope. Aircraft pass through huge outside temperature variations and, in addition, provide heated cabin environments. To make use of these temperature differences most efficiently, additional effort for heat conduction and installation is required to maintain the temperature gradient. However, to keep the complexity of system implementation as low as possible we report in this paper on an aircraft-specific thermoelectric generator module which consists of a phase-change material attached to the thermoelectric generator at one side. If this module is exposed to the environmental conditions of an aircraft envelope, the phase transition and heat capacity of the attached material lead to unbalanced temperature levels on the two sides of the generator. Simulations with realistic aircraft parameters have been done and first tests of the breadboard in a climate chamber have shown promising results.",J ELECTRON MATER,SEP,2010,10.1007/s11664-009-0997-7,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied",644PW,WOS:000281393000132
"Environmental effects of Information and Communication Technology - Exploring the roles of renewable energy, innovation, trade and financial development",RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS,"The increasing energy demand of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) devices, has drawn the attention of researchers and policymakers. Given that ICT devices are used in almost all sectors of the economy, any effort towards climate-change mitigation should consider the carbon-footprint of the ICT sector. In this study, we analyze the direct effects of ICT on environment as well as the indirect effects through interaction with renewable energy, innovation, trade, and financial development using Driscoll-Kraay Panel Corrected Estimators for 16 emerging countries from 2000 to 2018. We also examine the presence of Environmental Kuznets' Curve (EKC) hypothesis for the entire sample. We find that increasing internet-use, renewable-energy consumption and trade significantly reduces CO2 emission, while increase in non-renewable energy consumption significantly increases emission. Interaction between innovation and internet-use jointly reduces CO2 emission. Similarly, renewable-energy, innovation, trade and financial-development reduce the CO2 emission from increased mobile use. EKC hypothesis is found to be present for both internet and mobile-use. For internet-use, the emerging economies have already reached the turning point of EKC whereby increasing internet-penetration reduces CO2 emission. However, mobile-use has not yet reached its turning point of the EKC curve. Robustness check using Bootstrapped Panel-Quantile Regression also confirms that internet-use and renewable-energy consumption reduces CO2 emission, whereas innovation and non-renewable energy consumption increases emission across all quantiles. The results suggest that the emerging economies can safely increase internet-use and related applications to reduce emission. They should also increase the use of renewables and green-innovation technologies in telecommunication-sector to reduce their adverse effects on the environment.",RENEW SUST ENERG REV,JAN,2022,10.1016/j.rser.2021.111754,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels,YI0YJ,WOS:000743582700004

Anaerobic oxidation has a minor effect on mitigating seafloor methane emissions from gas hydrate dissociation,COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT,"Continental margin sediments contain large reservoirs of methane stored as gas hydrate. Ocean warming will partly destabilize these reservoirs which may lead to the release of substantial, yet unconstrained, amounts of methane. Anaerobic oxidation of methane is the dominant biogeochemical process to reduce methane flux, estimated to consume 90% of the methane produced in marine sediments today. This process is however neglected in the current projections of seafloor methane release from gas hydrate dissociation. Here, we introduce a fully coupled oxidation module to a hydraulic-thermodynamic-geomechanical hydrate model. Our results show that for seafloor warming rates > 1 degrees C century(-1), the efficiency of anaerobic oxidation of methane in low permeability sediments is poor, reducing the seafloor methane emissions by <5%. The results imply an extremely low mitigating effect of anaerobic oxidation of methane on climate warming-induced seafloor methane emissions. Microbial anaerobic oxidation of methane may not substantially mitigate projected warming-induced emissions of methane from marine hydrate-bearing sediments, according to a coupled hydraulic-thermodynamic-geomechanical hydrate model.",COMMUN EARTH ENVIRON,JUL 28,2022,10.1038/s43247-022-00490-x,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",3I4SX,WOS:000832709800001
Environmental Sustainability Coding Techniques for Cloud Computing,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS,"Cloud Computing (CC) has recently received substantial attention, as a promising approach for providing various information and communication technologies (ICT) services. Running enormously complicated and sophisticated software on the cloud requires more energy and most of the energy is wasted. It is required to explore opportunities to reduce emission of carbon in the CC environment that causes global warming. Global warming affects environment and it is required to lessen greenhouse gas emissions which can be achieved by adopting energy-efficient technologies that largely need to reduce the energy consumption caused during computations, for storing data and during communications to achieve Green computing. In literature, most of the energy-saving techniques focus on hardware aspects. Many improvements can be done in regard to energy efficiency from the software perspective by considering and paying attention to the energy consumption aspects of software for environmental sustainability. The aim of the research is to propose energy-aware profiling environmental sustainability techniques based on parameterized development technique to reduce the energy that has been spent and measure its efficiency inured to support software developers to enhance their code development process in terms of reducing energy.

Acoustic species distribution models (aSDMs): A framework to forecast shifts in calling behaviour under climate change,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Species distribution models (SDMs) are a key tool for biogeography and climate change research, although current approaches have some significant drawbacks. The use of species occurrence constrains predictions of correlative models, while there is a general lack of eco-physiological data to develop mechanistic models. Passive acoustic monitoring is an emerging technique in ecology that may help to overcome these limitations. By remotely tracking animal behaviour across species geographical ranges, researchers can estimate the climatic breadth of species activity and provide a baseline for refined predictive models. However, such integrative approach still remains to be developed. Here, we propose the following: (a) a general and transferable method to build acoustic SDMs, a novel tool combining acoustic and biogeographical information, (b) a detailed comparison with standard correlative and mechanistic models, (c) a step-by-step guide to develop aSDMs and (d) a study case to assess their effectiveness and illustrate model outputs, using a year-round monitoring of calling behaviour of the Iberian tree frog at the thermal extremes of its distribution range. This method aims at forecasting changes in environmental suitability for acoustic communication, a key and climate-dependent behaviour for a wide variety of animal taxa. aSDMs identified strong associations between calling behaviour and local environmental conditions and showed robust and consistent predictive performance using two alternative models (regression and boundary). Furthermore, these models better captured climatic variation than correlative models as they use observations at higher temporal resolution. These results support aSDMs as efficient tools to model calling behaviour under future climate scenarios. The proposed approach offers a promising basis to explore the capacity of vocal species to deal with climate change, supported by an innovative integration of two disciplines: bioacoustics and biogeography. aSMDs are grounded on ecologically realistic conditions and provide spatially and temporally explicit predictions on calling behaviour, with direct implications in reproduction and survival. This enables to precisely forecast shifts in breeding phenology, geographic distribution or species persistence. Our study demonstrates how acoustic monitoring may represent an increasingly valuable tool for climate change research.",METHODS ECOL EVOL,OCT,2022,10.1111/2041-210X.13923,Ecology,5B6CS,WOS:000824103900001
The role of highly oxygenated organic molecules in the Boreal aerosol-cloud-climate system,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"Over Boreal regions, monoterpenes emitted from the forest are the main precursors for secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation and the primary driver of the growth of new aerosol particles to climatically important cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Autoxidation of monoterpenes leads to rapid formation of Highly Oxygenated organic Molecules (HOM). We have developed the first model with near-explicit representation of atmospheric new particle formation (NPF) and HOM formation. The model can reproduce the observed NPF, HOM gas-phase composition and SOA formation over the Boreal forest. During the spring, HOM SOA formation increases the CCN concentration by similar to 10 % and causes a direct aerosol radiative forcing of -0.10 W/m(2). In contrast, NPF reduces the number of CCN at updraft velocities < 0.2 m/s, and causes a direct aerosol radiative forcing of +0.15 W/m(2). Hence, while HOM SOA contributes to climate cooling, NPF can result in climate warming over the Boreal forest.",NAT COMMUN,SEP 25,2019,10.1038/s41467-019-12338-8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,JA1OF,WOS:000487585600031
Between Empowering and Blaming Mechanisms in Developing Political/Economic Responses to Climate Change,SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY,"This conceptual paper reviews four dimensions of the climate change (CC) debate concerning perception, framing, and political and economic dimensions of CC. It attempts to address the question posed by sociological research as to what can be done to reduce the social forces driving CC. In doing so, it attempts to uncover mechanisms that delay or prevent the social change required to combat CC. Such mechanisms call into question the Ecological Modernization Theory's assumption that modern societies embrace environmental sustainability with no radical intervention to change the social, political, and economic order. It specifically considers how the representation of CC as a distant phenomenon, in both temporal and physical terms, might contribute to social disengagement. A reflection on the interdependencies among science, political economy, media, and individual perceptions guides this paper. All these social forces also shape the CC discourse in diverse ways according to the evolution of the phenomenon over time (in scientific, but also in political and economic terms) and in relation to its spatial dimension (global/national/local). The variety of climate discourses contributes to increasing political uncertainty; however, this is not the only factor that generates confusion around the CC. Multiple and contrasting information might trigger a blaming/empowering game that works at various levels.

Seasonal patterns of carbon dioxide and water fluxes in three representative tundra ecosystems in northern Alaska,ECOSPHERE,"Understanding the carbon dioxide and water fluxes in the Arctic is essential for accurate assessment and prediction of the responses of these ecosystems to climate change. In the Arctic, there have been relatively few studies of net CO2, water, and energy exchange using micrometeorological methods due to the difficulty of performing these measurements in cold, remote regions. When these measurements are performed, they are usually collected only during the short summer growing season. We established eddy covariance flux towers in three representative Alaska tundra ecosystems (heath tundra, tussock tundra, and wet sedge tundra), and have collected CO2, water, and energy flux data continuously for over three years (September 2007-May 2011). In all ecosystems, peak CO2 uptake occurred during July, with accumulations of similar to 51-95 g C/m(2) during June-August. The timing of the switch from CO2 source to sink in the spring appears to be regulated by the number of growing degree days early in the season, indicating that warmer springs may promote increased net CO2 uptake. However, this increased uptake in the spring may be lost through warmer temperatures in the late growing season that promote respiration, if this respiration is not impeded by large amounts of precipitation or cooler temperatures. Net CO2 accumulation during the growing season was generally lost through respiration during the snow covered months of September-May, turning the ecosystems into net sources of CO2 over measurement period. The water balance from June to August at the three ecosystems was variable, with the most variability observed in the heath tundra, and the least in the tussock tundra. These findings underline the importance of collecting data over the full annual cycle and across multiple types of tundra ecosystems in order to come to a more complete understanding of CO2 and water fluxes in the Arctic.",ECOSPHERE,JAN,2012,10.1890/ES11-00202.1,Ecology,256GT,WOS:000327298400004
A wise person plants a tree a day before the end of the world: coping with the emotional experience of climate change in Poland,CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY,"It is now widely accepted that we are in a climate emergency, and the number of people who are concerned about this problem is growing. Yet, qualitative, in-depth studies to investigate the emotional response to climate change were conducted either in high-income, western countries, or in low-income countries particularly vulnerable to climate change. To our knowledge, there are no qualitative studies conducted in countries that share great barriers to decarbonization while being significant contributors to carbon emissions. Since climate change affects people globally, it is crucial to study this topic in a variety of socio-political contexts. In this work, we discuss views and reflections voiced by highly concerned residents of Poland, a Central European country that is a major contributor to Europe's carbon emissions. We conducted 40 semi-structured interviews with Polish residents, who self-identified as concerned about climate change. A variety of emotions related to climate change were identified and placed in the context of four major themes: dangers posed by climate change, the inevitability of its consequences, attributions of responsibility, and commonality of concern. Our findings highlight a variety of often ambivalent and conflicting emotions that change along with the participant's thoughts, experiences and behaviours. Furthermore, we describe a wide repertoire of coping strategies, which promoted well-being and sustained long-term engagement in climate action. As such, our work contributes to research on a broad array of climate-related emotions.",CURR PSYCHOL,2022 OCT 14,2022,10.1007/s12144-022-03807-3,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",5Q7HC,WOS:000873996800002
Life cycle assessment estimation for eco-management of co-generation systems,JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESOURCES TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME,"A LCA (life cycle assessment) scheme for any industrial activity system is introduced to estimate the quantitative loan on the environment with the aid of the NETS (numerical environment total standard) method proposed by the authors as a numerical measure. Two kinds of environmental loads respecting fossil fuel depletion as input resources to the system and global warming due to CO2 emission as output are taken into account in the present eco-criterion, in which the total eco-load (EcL) value is calculated from the summation of respective environmental load factors on the whole process in a life cycle of the system. This NETS method is applied to eco-management co-generation systems, in which a computer-aided output navigator proceeds the LCA estimation,with ICON and Q&A communication.

Transient hydrodynamic effects influence organic carbon signatures in marine sediments,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"Ocean dynamics served an important role during past dramatic climate changes via impacts on deep-ocean carbon storage. Such changes are recorded in sedimentary proxies of hydrographic change on continental margins, which lie at the ocean-atmosphere-earth interface. However, interpretations of these records are challenging, given complex interplays among processes delivering particulate material to and from ocean margins. Here we report radiocarbon (C-14) signatures measured for organic carbon in differing grain-size sediment fractions and foraminifera in a sediment core retrieved from the southwest Iberian margin, spanning the last similar to 25,000 yr. Variable differences of 0-5000 yr in radiocarbon age are apparent between organic carbon in differing grain-sizes and foraminifera of the same sediment layer. The magnitude of C-14 differences co-varies with key paleoceanographic indices (e.g., proximal bottom-current density gradients), which we interpret as evidence of Atlantic-Mediterranean seawater exchange influencing grain-size specific carbon accumulation and translocation. These findings underscore an important link between regional hydrodynamics and interpretations of down-core sedimentary proxies.",NAT COMMUN,NOV 8,2018,10.1038/s41467-018-06973-w,Multidisciplinary Sciences,GZ5UF,WOS:000449494100015
Standard Implementation of Teaching Factory 6 Step Model (TF-6M) Learning,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2015 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INNOVATION IN ENGINEERING AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION,"Learning Teaching Factory 6 Steps Model (TF-6M Model) is a learning model that can create industrial climate at schools, can improve students' competencies and can produce vocational students with entrepreneur spirit. TF-6M Model as a concept had been refined through researches that strengthened the concept, resulting in formulation of the operational implementation of the model. The formulation consists of the implementation of TF-6M Model at skill competency, which integrates a particular productive subject or several productive subjects combined with entrepreneur subjects and is held in time block coupled with Industrial Working Practices (Praktek Kerja Lapangan (Prakerin)) followed by a competency test and ended with a development of Map/Web Rehearsal-based entrepreneur craft. TF-6M Model was implemented in class XI on Culinary skill competency at SMK 3 Garut and Refrigeration and Air Control skill competency at SMK TI Cimahi. In the implementation of TF-6M Model in both skill competencies, the indicators of students' soft skill and hard skill competencies can be achieved perfectly, including the entrepreneurship competency. Implementation Standards of TF-6M Model, which can be used as a common reference in implementing TF-6M Model, were also produced. Implementations Standards of TF-6M Model consists of: 1. Preparation of implementation, which includes: - changing the management/school climate into industrial climate; - Practicing communication; and - exercising order analysis. 2. Implementation, which includes: - preliminary stage; - core stage; and concluding/evaluation stage. The strategies, approaches and learning methods in standard implementation of TF-6M Model consist of: problem solving; scientific approach; inquiry discovery; question and answer method; discussions; role play; Contextual Teaching Learning (CTL); social consensus; reel job; reel teaching; authentic learning and authentic evaluation, problem-based learning; production-based learning. Implementation of TF-6M Model requires dedication because the obstacles and challenges during early stages need to be overcome. These obstacles and challenges consist of: 1. the ability to convince the principals to implement TF-6M Model since the implementation requires principals' policies; 2. the resistances from teachers because they dislike/feel disturbed by changes; - overestimate/underestimate TF-6M Model; - show unprofessional attitude. Teachers who are expected and required to run this model are productive teachers who love vocational competencies and teaching profession.",ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,NA,2016,NA,"Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",BF0PT,WOS:000379261800061
Climate change health assessment: a novel approach for Alaska Native communities,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIRCUMPOLAR HEALTH,"Objectives. Develop a process for assessing climate change impacts on public health that identifies climate-health vulnerabilities and mechanisms and encourages adaptation. Study design. Multi-stakeholder, participatory, qualitative research. Methods. A Climate Change Health Assessment (CCHA) was developed that involved 4 steps: (1) scoping to describe local conditions and engage stakeholders; (2) surveying to collect descriptive and quantitative data; (3) analysis to evaluate the data; and (4) planning to communicate findings and explore appropriate actions with community members. The health effects related to extreme weather, thinning ice, erosion, flooding, thawing permafrost and changing conditions of water and food resources were considered. Results. The CCHA process was developed and performed in north-west Arctic villages. Refinement of the process took place in Point Hope, a coastal Inupiat village that practices whaling and a variety of other traditional subsistence harvest practices. Local observers identified climate change impacts that resulted in damaged health infrastructure, compromised food and water security and increased risk of injury. Priority health issues included thawing traditional ice cellars, diminished quality of the community water source and increased safety issues related to sea ice change. The CCHA increased awareness about health vulnerability and encouraged informed planning and decision-making. Conclusion. A community-scale assessment process guided by observation-based data can identify climate health impacts, raise awareness and encourage adaptive actions, thereby improving the response capacity of communities vulnerable to climate change.

Power Saving Protocol for 10G-EPON Systems: A Proposal and Performance Evaluations,2012 IEEE GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE (GLOBECOM),"Reducing power consumption in access networks has become an increasingly important design goal due to increased concerns for both global warming and network operation costs. Although passive optical networks (PONs) consume the least power among all access network technologies, it is desirable to further reduce PON's power consumption, especially when the line rate is being increased to 10Gbps (10G) and wider deployment is underway. Generally, an effective approach to reduce power consumption is to use sleep-mode operation where functionality is powered off during periods of idleness. This paper therefore proposes a sleep-mode based power saving protocol applied to an optical line terminal (OLT) and optical network units (ONUs) to implement ONU power saving in 10G-Ethernet- PON (10G-EPON) systems. The proposed protocol explicitly distinguishes sleep-, listen-, and awake-states with different power consumption levels. In addition, the paper proposes analytical models for ONU power consumption and response delay to evaluate performance of the proposed power saving protocol. The simulations show that the proposed protocol can significantly improve ONU power saving. The validity of the numerical models is also confirmed by extensive simulations.",IEEE GLOB COMM CONF,NA,2012,NA,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",BGD24,WOS:000322375103080
Hot topics in science communication: Aggressive language decreases trustworthiness and credibility in scientific debates,PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENCE,"Current scientific debates, such as on climate change, often involve emotional, hostile, and aggressive rhetorical styles. Those who read or listen to these kinds of scientific arguments have to decide whom they can trust and which information is credible. This study investigates how the language style (neutral vs aggressive) and the professional affiliation (scientist vs lobbyist) of a person arguing in a scientific debate influence his trustworthiness and the credibility of his information. In a 2 X 2 between-subject online experiment, participants watched a scientific debate. The results show that if the person was introduced as a lobbyist, he was perceived as less trustworthy. However, the person's professional affiliation did not affect the credibility of his information. If the person used an aggressive language style, he was perceived as less trustworthy. Furthermore, his information was perceived as less credible, and participants had the impression that they learned less from the scientific debate.",PUBLIC UNDERST SCI,MAY,2019,10.1177/0963662519833903,Communication; History & Philosophy Of Science,HS7EE,WOS:000464032000002
Empowering Rural Farmers to Improve Livelihoods Through Environmental Risk Communication: A Case Study of Uganda,AGRICULTURE AND ECOSYSTEM RESILIENCE IN SUB SAHARAN AFRICA: LIVELIHOOD PATHWAYS UNDER CHANGING CLIMATE,"The chapter examines how effective environmental risk communication can empower rural farmers in Africa to improve their livelihoods, using Uganda as a case study. Specifically looking at climate change that is considered a global risk, the chapter explores how media are domesticating the climate issues to meet the grassroots' right to relevant information, thereby assessing how media are carrying out their Responsibility to Protect (R2P) the vulnerable rural farmers. The analysis is based on primary findings from a survey of rural farmers that assessed their access to environment and climate change information, the extent they perceived these as risks at the personal, community and national levels and the relevancy of the information received. Findings showed that although farmers perceived climate change as a big risk, they did not go beyond the risk identification and risk assessment stages to the last stage of taking action for risk reduction/protection as the information received from the media was not solution-oriented. Rather than engage in risk communication or risk dialogue that is a participatory process, media engaged more in risk information giving. Gaps to effective risk communication are highlighted, and strategies presented to address them to ensure media carry out their R2P to the rural farmers. These findings provide a useful guide in effective environmental risk communication to rural farmers that should result into better adaptation to CC and improved production, thus contributing to a reduction in poverty levels and overall development in Africa.",CLIM CHANG MANAG,NA,2019,10.1007/978-3-030-12974-3_26,Agricultural Engineering; Area Studies; Ecology; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,BN9MZ,WOS:000489289500028

"Simulation of CO2 plume movement in multilayered saline formations through multilayer injection technology in the Ordos Basin, China",ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"Deep saline aquifers still remain a significant option for the disposal of large amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere as a means of mitigating global climate change. The small scale Carbon Capture and Sequestration demonstration project in Ordos Basin, China, operated by the Shenhua Group, is the only one of its kind in Asia, to put the multilayer injection technology into practice. This paper aims at studying the influence of temperature, injection rate and horizontal boundary effects on CO2 plume transport in saline formation layers at different depths and thicknesses, focusing on the variations in CO2 gas saturation and mass fraction of dissolved CO2 in the formation of brine in the plume's radial three-dimensional field around the injection point, and interlayer communication between the aquifer and its confining beds of relatively lower permeability. The study uses the ECO2N module of TOUGH2 to simulate flow and pressure configurations in response to small-scale CO2 injection into multilayer saline aquifers. The modelling domain involves a complex multilayer reservoir-caprock system, comprising of a sequence of sandstone aquifers and sealing units of mudstone and siltstone layers extending from the Permian Shanxi to the Upper Triassic Liujiagou formation systems in the Ordos Basin. Simulation results indicate that CO2 injected for storage into deep saline aquifers cause a significant pressure perturbation in the geological system that may require a long duration in the post-injection period to establish new pressure equilibrium. The multilayer simultaneous injection scheme exhibits mutual interference with the intervening sealing layers, especially when the injection layers are very close to each other and the corresponding sealing layers are thin. The study further reveals that injection rate and temperature are the most significant factors for determining the lateral and vertical extent that the CO2 plume reaches and which phase and amount will exist at a particular time during and after the injection. In general, a large number of factors may influence the CO2-water fluid flow system considering the complexity in the real geologic sequence and structural configurations. Therefore, optimization of a CO2 injection scheme still requires pursuance of further studies.",ENVIRON EARTH SCI,MAY,2014,10.1007/s12665-013-2839-4,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Water Resources",AF7RY,WOS:000334913500015
What Can We Learn from Comparing Glacio-Hydrological Models?,ATMOSPHERE,"Glacio-hydrological models combine both glacier and catchment hydrology modeling and are used to assess the hydrological response of high-mountain glacierized catchments to climate change. To capture the uncertainties from these model combinations, it is essential to compare the outcomes of several model entities forced with the same climate projections. For the first time, we compare the results of two completely independent glacio-hydrological models: (i) HQsim-GEM and (ii) AMUNDSEN. In contrast to prevailing studies, we use distinct glacier models and glacier initialization times. At first glance, the results achieved for future glacier states and hydrological characteristics in the Rofenache catchment in otztal Alps (Austria) appear to be similar and consistent, but a closer look reveals clear differences. What can be learned from this study is that low-complexity models can achieve higher accuracy in the calibration period. This is advantageous especially when data availability is weak, and priority is given to efficient computation time. Furthermore, the time and method of glacier initialization play an important role due to different data requirements. In essence, it is not possible to make conclusions about the model performance outside of the calibration period or more specifically in the future. Hence, similar to climate modeling, we suggest considering different modeling approaches when assessing future catchment discharge or glacier evolution. Especially when transferring the results to stakeholders, it is vital to transparently communicate the bandwidth of future states that come with all model results.",ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,SEP,2020,10.3390/atmos11090981,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,OE7JI,WOS:000580702100001
Estimation of Solar Photovoltaic Parameters Using Pattern Search Algorithm,"EMERGING TRENDS IN ELECTRICAL, ELECTRONIC AND COMMUNICATIONS ENGINEERING, ELECOM 2016","The interest towards solar Photovoltaic (PV) based power generation has increased worldwide due to climate change and depletion of fossil fuels. This has led to the need for accurate solar PV modelling under different environmental conditions. Since solar PV shows nonlinear characteristics, optimization technique is the best tool for modelling and estimation of PV parameters. Thus, in this paper, a Pattern Search (PS) algorithm is proposed to optimize the parameters of solar photovoltaic panels. The objective is to identify the parameters of single diode model based PV, in such a way that the difference between PV experimental current and simulated current is minimal. The effectiveness of the algorithms is investigated through simulation in MATLAB/Simulink environment at different solar irradiance and temperature and it is compared with the experimental data of solar module Kyocera - KC200GT 215. Results clearly reveal that the proposed technique shows better results in terms of its accuracy, convergence and CPU execution time.",LECT NOTES ELECTR EN,NA,2017,10.1007/978-3-319-52171-8_15,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",BI9IG,WOS:000416104200015
Walking the road together? EU polity maintenance during the COVID-19 crisis,WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS,"This article investigates the 'conflict parabola' of the negotiations between EU member states during the COVID-19 pandemic. The crisis reopened the foundational controversy over cross-national solidarity under economic adversities. After a peak of conflict in March-April 2020, the political climate gradually shifted from antagonism to appeasement, creating the conditions necessary for the adoption of the Next Generation EU plan. Building on the negative experiences of past crises, some EU leaders engaged in a strategy of 'polity maintenance', i.e. keeping the EU polity together, regardless of interest-based divisions. This strategy mainly rested on public communication. The article documents both conflict and appeasement by analysing a corpus of leaders' quotes drawn from the press (covering eight countries) and a corpus of speeches by Angela Merkel. The Chancellor made a high political investment in EU polity maintenance, presenting European cohesion as part and parcel of Germany's national interest.",WEST EUR POLIT,SEP 19,2021,10.1080/01402382.2021.1905328,Political Science,TE0SF,WOS:000640626900001
Disruptive Technologies in Smart Farming: An Expanded View with Sentiment Analysis,AGRIENGINEERING,"Smart Farming (SF) is an emerging technology in the current agricultural landscape. The aim of Smart Farming is to provide tools for various agricultural and farming operations to improve yield by reducing cost, waste, and required manpower. SF is a data-driven approach that can mitigate losses that occur due to extreme weather conditions and calamities. The influx of data from various sensors, and the introduction of information communication technologies (ICTs) in the field of farming has accelerated the implementation of disruptive technologies (DTs) such as machine learning and big data. Application of these predictive and innovative tools in agriculture is crucial for handling unprecedented conditions such as climate change and the increasing global population. In this study, we review the recent advancements in the field of Smart Farming, which include novel use cases and projects around the globe. An overview of the challenges associated with the adoption of such technologies in their respective regions is also provided. A brief analysis of the general sentiment towards Smart Farming technologies is also performed by manually annotating YouTube comments and making use of the pattern library. Preliminary findings of our study indicate that, though there are several barriers to the implementation of SF tools, further research and innovation can alleviate such risks and ensure sustainability of the food supply.

Environmental friendly food. Choice experiment to assess consumer's attitude toward climate neutral milk: the role of communication,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,"The livestock sector has a high impact in terms of carbon footprint. Lowering GHG emission from the livestock sector deals with implementing climate neutral production techniques in a cost effectiveness way and with developing market communication to make carbon free diary products competitive with alternative products. This study aimed at analyzing how information and communications could impact or affect the consumer's attitude toward climate neutral fresh milk. The research focused on a case study carried out in Tuscany among a sample of supermarket customers, to assess consumer attitude toward fresh climate neutral milk using choice experiments methods. The participants were asked to attend a focus group meeting made of four different sessions. During the first session participants were asked to fill a background questionnaire and to watch a short documentary video about the climate change risks. A second session consisted in a choice experiment in which participants were presented with 12 choices, each describing a scenario in which the milk key attributes were planned at different levels (price, organic labeling and carbon footprint labeling). During the third session the focus group discussions was developed following a semi-structured debate about environmental labeling, climate neutral labeling and the environmental impact of individual's purchasing behavior. In the fourth session participants were asked to express their preferences on the choice-sets with the same scenarios presented in the second session, in order to assess variation in individual willingness to pay (WTP) toward climate neutral and organic milk.

Environmental Law/Environmental Literature,ECOLOGY LAW QUARTERLY,"What, is truly environmental about environmental law? This Article is the first attempt to answer this question by integrating Law & Literature scholarship with the study of environmental law. I argue that competing narratives of nature and culture common to the American environmental imagination play a more significant role in environmental law and litigation than previously acknowledged. These competing narratives, communicated through a known set of environmental stories and tropes, are used by attorneys to establish, frame, narrate and argue their cases, and they are absorbed, reimagined, reframed and retold by judges in their written opinions, making environmental law a kind of expressive, literary event. To illustrate this process, the Article examines two important and highly visible case studies: the reintroduction of gray wolves into the Northern Rocky Mountains and the public nuisance climate change lawsuit that culminated in the Supreme Court's decision in Connecticut v. American Electric Power. A close reading of the pleadings, legal briefs and judicial opinions in these case studies demonstrates that courts respond to and reinforce traditional environmental stories, such as wilderness tales and the environmental apocalyptic, but evince a strong preference for a less well-known story, which I call the Progressive Management Machine. The Progressive Management Machine promises reconciliation of competing environmental narratives through administrative process and science-driven decision making, but, in so doing, masks its own contravention of those same narratives. The approach developed here launches a larger project exploring the dynamic relationship between environmental law, literature and narrative. This Article, like the larger project, seeks to elucidate not only various litigators' and judges' rhetorical strategies but also the purposes, content and significance of environmental law.",ECOL LAW QUART,NA,2013,NA,Environmental Studies; Law,171ZW,WOS:000320970400001
Liquid-liquid phase separation reduces radiative absorption by aged black carbon aerosols,COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT,"Black carbon aerosols absorb radiation and their absorptive strength is influenced by particle mixing structures and coating compositions. Liquid-liquid phase separation can move black carbon to organic particle coatings which affects absorptive capacity, but it is unclear which conditions favour this redistribution. Here we combine field observations, laboratory experiments, and transmission electron microscopy to demonstrate that liquid-liquid phase separation redistributes black carbon from inorganic particle cores to organic coatings under a wide range of relative humidity. We find that the ratio of organic coating thickness to black carbon size influences the redistribution. When the ratio is lower than 0.12, over 90% of black carbon is inside inorganic salt cores. However, when the ratio exceeds 0.24, most black carbon is redistributed to organic coatings, due to a change in its affinity for inorganic and organic phases. Using an optical calculation model, we estimate that black carbon redistribution reduces the absorption enhancement effect by 28-34%. We suggest that climate models assuming a core-shell particle structure probably overestimate radiative absorption of black carbon aerosols by approximately 18%. Redistribution of black carbon from the inorganic core to the organic coating of aged aerosols due to liquid-liquid phase separation can reduce radiative absorption by up to 34%, according to field observations and laboratory experiments.",COMMUN EARTH ENVIRON,JUN 2,2022,10.1038/s43247-022-00462-1,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",1U1LE,WOS:000805179500002
Pathways towards a sustainable future envisioned by early-career conservation researchers,CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE,"Scientists have warned decision-makers about the severe consequences of the global environmental crisis since the 1970s. Yet ecological degradation continues and little has been done to address climate change. We investigated early-career conservation researchers' (ECR) perspectives on, and prioritization of, actions furthering sustainability. We conducted a survey (n = 67) and an interactive workshop (n = 35) for ECR attendees of the 5th European Congress of Conservation Biology (2018).

These include increased transdisciplinarity, science communication, advocacy in conservation, and adoption of a transformation-oriented social-ecological systems approach to research. The respondents and participants had diverse perspectives on how to achieve sustainability. Reformist actions were emphasized as paving the way for more radical changes in the economic system and societal values linked to the environment and inequality. Our findings suggest that achieving sustainability requires a strategy that (1) incorporates the multiplicity of people's views, (2) places a greater value on nature, and (3) encourages systemic transformation across political, social, educational, and economic realms on multiple levels.

Influence of climate change on agricultural land-use potential: adapting and updating the land capability system for Scotland,CLIMATE RESEARCH,"Land capability systems have been designed to evaluate and communicate biophysical constraints on land use, including climatic limitations. By grading land quality, the resulting information is particularly relevant for planners and managers, and for land valuation. Higher-grade land is more flexible and has more options for land Use. Using Scotland as a case study, a widely-Used land capability system was adapted to investigate the influence of recent and future climate change on land-use potential. The adapted method was applied to both interpolated gridded weather station data and to future climate change scenarios derived from the HadRM3 climate model. At a national scale, differing regional patterns of land capability were recognised, with changes in these patterns occurring in recent decades and projected to occur on a more substantial scale into the future. In general, climate change is acting to enhance land-use potential in Scotland, mainly in the drier east, while the west remains constrained by its wetter climate. These results demonstrate the key control directed by soil moisture values on land-use options, in addition to temperature change. Shifts in land-use potential have implications for both strategic resource planning and for developing anticipatory climate change adaptation actions. The land capability assessment highlights not. only potential changes in agriculture and other productive land uses, but also repercussions for biodiversity and terrestrial carbon stocks. Various amendments are suggested to the land capability procedures to reflect existing or emerging climate-related issues that were not considered necessary in the original system, notably excessive soil moisture deficits.",CLIM RES,AUG 7,2008,10.3354/cr00753,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,365LG,WOS:000260407300005
